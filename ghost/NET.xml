			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
				<verse number="3">Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,</verse>
				<verse number="4">Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
				<verse number="5">Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and Jesse the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah ),</verse>
				<verse number="7">Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,</verse>
				<verse number="8">Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,</verse>
				<verse number="9">Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</verse>
				<verse number="10">Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
				<verse number="13">Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,</verse>
				<verse number="14">Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,</verse>
				<verse number="15">Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="21">She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:</verse>
				<verse number="23">“ Look! The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,” which means “ God with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,</verse>
				<verse number="25">but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem</verse>
				<verse number="2">saying, “Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">When King Herod heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“In Bethlehem of Judea,” they said, “for it is written this way by the prophet:</verse>
				<verse number="6">‘ And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are in no way least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and look carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me so that I can go and worship him as well.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">After listening to the king they left, and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back by another route to their own country.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He stayed there until Herod died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled: “ I called my Son out of Egypt.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became enraged. He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“ A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud wailing, Rachel weeping for her children, and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</verse>
				<verse number="20">saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child’s life are dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness of Judea proclaiming,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">For he is the one about whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken: “ The voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.’”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now John wore clothing made from camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then people from Jerusalem, as well as all Judea and all the region around the Jordan, were going out to him,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I baptize you with water, for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am — I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
				<verse number="12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Jesus replied to him, “Let it happen now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John yielded to him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">After Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And a voice from heaven said, “This is my one dear Son; in him I take great delight.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After he fasted forty days and forty nights he was famished.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But he answered, “It is written, ‘ Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the highest point of the temple,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, ‘ He will command his angels concerning you ’ and ‘ with their hands they will lift you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘ You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their grandeur.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And he said to him, “I will give you all these things if you throw yourself to the ground and worship me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘ You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he went into Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="13">While in Galilee, he moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
				<verse number="14">so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled:</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way by the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles —</verse>
				<verse number="16">the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, and on those who sit in the region and shadow of death a light has dawned.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">From that time Jesus began to preach this message: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon (called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
				<verse number="19">He said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">They left their nets immediately and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. Then he called them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and sickness among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So a report about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions, those who had seizures, paralytics, and those possessed by demons, and he healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan River.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain. After he sat down his disciples came to him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then he began to teach them by saying:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Rejoice and be glad because your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets before you in the same way.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled on by people.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
				<verse number="15">People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In the same way, let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good deeds and give honor to your Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter will pass from the law until everything takes place.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever obeys them and teaches others to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“You have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘ Do not murder,’ and ‘whoever murders will be subjected to judgment.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subjected to judgment. And whoever insults a brother will be brought before the council, and whoever says ‘Fool’ will be sent to fiery hell.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So then, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
				<verse number="24">leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your gift.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Reach agreement quickly with your accuser while on the way to court, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the warden, and you will be thrown into prison.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I tell you the truth, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny!</verse>
				<verse number="27">“You have heard that it was said, ‘ Do not commit adultery.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="30">If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“It was said, ‘ Whoever divorces his wife must give her a legal document.’</verse>
				<verse number="32">But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Again, you have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘ Do not break an oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">But I say to you, do not take oaths at all — not by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
				<verse number="35">not by earth, because it is his footstool, and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Do not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Let your word be ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no.’ More than this is from the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="38">“You have heard that it was said, ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</verse>
				<verse number="39">But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer. But whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And if someone wants to sue you and to take your tunic, give him your coat also.</verse>
				<verse number="41">And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Give to the one who asks you, and do not reject the one who wants to borrow from you.</verse>
				<verse number="43">“You have heard that it was said, ‘ Love your neighbor ’ and ‘hate your enemy.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
				<verse number="45">so that you may be like your Father in heaven, since he causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
				<verse number="46">For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don’t they?</verse>
				<verse number="47">And if you only greet your brothers, what more do you do? Even the Gentiles do the same, don’t they?</verse>
				<verse number="48">So then, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">“Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people. Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Thus whenever you do charitable giving, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in synagogues and on streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth, they have their reward.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But when you do your giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
				<verse number="4">so that your gift may be in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that by their many words they will be heard.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So pray this way: Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored,</verse>
				<verse number="10">may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Give us today our daily bread,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“For if you forgive others their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“When you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unattractive so that people will see them fasting. I tell you the truth, they have their reward.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</verse>
				<verse number="18">so that it will not be obvious to others when you are fasting, but only to your Father who is in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</verse>
				<verse number="24">“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t there more to life than food and more to the body than clothing?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Look at the birds in the sky: They do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you more valuable than they are?</verse>
				<verse number="27">And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life?</verse>
				<verse number="28">Why do you worry about clothing? Think about how the flowers of the field grow; they do not work or spin.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these!</verse>
				<verse number="30">And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, won’t he clothe you even more, you people of little faith?</verse>
				<verse number="31">So then, don’t worry saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’</verse>
				<verse number="32">For the unconverted pursue these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
				<verse number="34">So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">“Do not judge so that you will not be judged.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while there is a beam in your own?</verse>
				<verse number="5">You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Is there anyone among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</verse>
				<verse number="11">If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</verse>
				<verse number="12">In everything, treat others as you would want them to treat you, for this fulfills the law and the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Enter through the narrow gate, because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life, and there are few who find it.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles, are they?</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree to bear good fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So then, you will recognize them by their fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven — only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="22">On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds?’</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!’</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed; it was utterly destroyed!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed by his teaching,</verse>
				<verse number="29">because he taught them like one who had authority, not like their experts in the law.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And a leper approached, and bowed low before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Jesus said to him, “See that you do not speak to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him asking for help:</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Instead, just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go’ and he goes, and to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith in anyone in Israel!</verse>
				<verse number="11">I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="12">but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In this way what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled: “ He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then an expert in the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So they came and woke him up saying, “Lord, save us! We are about to die!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">But he said to them, “Why are you cowardly, you people of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was dead calm.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And the men were amazed and said, “What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They cried out, “Son of God, leave us alone! Have you come here to torment us before the time?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the demons begged him, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">And he said, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The herdsmen ran off, went into the town, and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">After getting into a boat he crossed to the other side and came to his own town.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Just then some people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, son! Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then some of the experts in the law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Jesus saw their reaction he said, “Why do you respond with evil in your hearts?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” — then he said to the paralytic — “Stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he stood up and went home.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When the crowd saw this, they were afraid and honored God who had given such authority to men.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. And he got up and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As Jesus was having a meal in Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Jesus heard this he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Go and learn what this saying means: ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
				<verse number="16">No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, because the patch will pull away from the garment and the tear will be worse.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled out and the skins are destroyed. Instead they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">As he was saying these things, a ruler came, bowed low before him, and said, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For she kept saying to herself, “If only I touch his cloak, I will be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when Jesus turned and saw her he said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When Jesus entered the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd,</verse>
				<verse number="24">he said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but asleep.” And they began making fun of him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and gently took her by the hand, and the girl got up.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And the news of this spread throughout that region.</verse>
				<verse number="27">As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When he went into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then he touched their eyes saying, “Let it be done for you according to your faith.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that entire region.</verse>
				<verse number="32">As they were going away, a man who could not talk and was demon-possessed was brought to him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">After the demon was cast out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">But the Pharisees said, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were bewildered and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so they could cast them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (called Peter), and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee and John his brother;</verse>
				<verse number="3">Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</verse>
				<verse number="4">Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows: “Do not go to Gentile regions and do not enter any Samaritan town.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do not take gold, silver, or copper in your belts,</verse>
				<verse number="10">no bag for the journey, or an extra tunic, or sandals or staff, for the worker deserves his provisions.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Whenever you enter a town or village, find out who is worthy there and stay with them until you leave.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As you enter the house, give it greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if the house is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or that town.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I am sending you out like sheep surrounded by wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Beware of people, because they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And you will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them and the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Whenever they hand you over for trial, do not worry about how to speak or what to say, for what you should say will be given to you at that time.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For it is not you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents and have them put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whenever they persecute you in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a slave greater than his master.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house ‘Beelzebul,’ how much more will they defame the members of his household!</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Do not be afraid of them, for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known.</verse>
				<verse number="27">What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light, and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Even all the hairs on your head are numbered.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Whoever, then, acknowledges me before people, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But whoever denies me before people, I will deny him also before my Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,</verse>
				<verse number="36">and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life because of me will find it.</verse>
				<verse number="40">“Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, I tell you the truth, he will never lose his reward. ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now when John heard in prison about the deeds Christ had done, he sent his disciples to ask a question:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus answered them, “Go tell John what you hear and see:</verse>
				<verse number="5">The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
				<verse number="8">What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? Look, those who wear fancy clothes are in the homes of kings!</verse>
				<verse number="9">What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This is the one about whom it is written: ‘ Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.</verse>
				<verse number="12">From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and forceful people lay hold of it.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, who is to come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The one who has ears had better listen!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“To what should I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another,</verse>
				<verse number="17">‘We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance; we wailed in mourning, yet you did not weep.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’</verse>
				<verse number="19">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many of his miracles, because they did not repent.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!</verse>
				<verse number="23">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Sodom, it would have continued to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.</verse>
				<verse number="27">All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Take my yoke on you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For my yoke is easy to bear, and my load is not hard to carry.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick heads of wheat and eat them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But when the Pharisees saw this they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is against the law to do on the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry —</verse>
				<verse number="4">how he entered the house of God and they ate the sacred bread, which was against the law for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Or have you not read in the law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are not guilty?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If you had known what this means: ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Jesus left that place and entered their synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="10">A man was there who had a withered hand. And they asked Jesus, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” so that they could accuse him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to them, “Would not any one of you, if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, take hold of it and lift it out?</verse>
				<verse number="12">How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and it was restored, as healthy as the other.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, as to how they could assassinate him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great crowds followed him, and he healed them all.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But he sternly warned them not to make him known.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This fulfilled what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet:</verse>
				<verse number="18">“ Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I take great delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He will not break a bruised reed or extinguish a smoldering wick, until he brings justice to victory.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see.</verse>
				<verse number="23">All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this one be the Son of David?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But when the Pharisees heard this they said, “He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and no town or house divided against itself will stand.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</verse>
				<verse number="27">And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you.</verse>
				<verse number="29">How else can someone enter a strong man’s house and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can thoroughly plunder the house.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is known by its fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say anything good, since you are evil? For the mouth speaks from what fills the heart.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The good person brings good things out of his good treasury, and the evil person brings evil things out of his evil treasury.</verse>
				<verse number="36">I tell you that on the day of judgment, people will give an account for every worthless word they speak.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then some of the experts in the law along with some Pharisees answered him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them — and now, something greater than Jonah is here!</verse>
				<verse number="42">The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon — and now, something greater than Solomon is here!</verse>
				<verse number="43">“When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through waterless places looking for rest but does not find it.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’ When it returns, it finds the house empty, swept clean, and put in order.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first. It will be that way for this evil generation as well!”</verse>
				<verse number="46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking to speak to him.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">To the one who had said this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”</verse>
				<verse number="49">And pointing toward his disciples he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
				<verse number="50">For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat to sit while the whole crowd stood on the shore.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil was not deep.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But when the sun came up, they were scorched, and because they did not have sufficient root, they withered.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Other seeds fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The one who has ears had better listen!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the disciples came to him and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He replied, “You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For whoever has will be given more, and will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For this reason I speak to them in parables: Although they see they do not see, and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And concerning them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: ‘ You will listen carefully yet will never understand, you will look closely yet will never comprehend.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For the heart of this people has become dull; they are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes, so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’</verse>
				<verse number="16">“But your eyes are blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“So listen to the parable of the sower:</verse>
				<verse number="19">When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart; this is the seed sown along the path.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The seed sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But he has no root in himself and does not endure; when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The seed sown among thorns is the person who hears the word, but worldly cares and the seductiveness of wealth choke the word, so it produces nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But as for the seed sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands. He bears fruit, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">He presented them with another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a person who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So the slaves of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?’</verse>
				<verse number="28">He said, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the slaves replied, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them?’</verse>
				<verse number="29">But he said, ‘No, since in gathering the weeds you may uproot the wheat with them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, but then gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</verse>
				<verse number="31">He gave them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.</verse>
				<verse number="32">It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest garden plant and becomes a tree, so that the wild birds come and nest in its branches.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not speak to them without a parable.</verse>
				<verse number="35">This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: “ I will open my mouth in parables, I will announce what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The field is the world and the good seed are the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,</verse>
				<verse number="39">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</verse>
				<verse number="40">As the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</verse>
				<verse number="41">The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as all lawbreakers.</verse>
				<verse number="42">They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears had better listen!</verse>
				<verse number="44">“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, that a person found and hid. Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.</verse>
				<verse number="46">When he found a pearl of great value, he went out and sold everything he had and bought it.</verse>
				<verse number="47">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish.</verse>
				<verse number="48">When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away.</verse>
				<verse number="49">It will be this way at the end of the age. Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous</verse>
				<verse number="50">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
				<verse number="51">“Have you understood all these things?” They replied, “Yes.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Then he said to them, “Therefore every expert in the law who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and old.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Now when Jesus finished these parables, he moved on from there.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said, “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?</verse>
				<verse number="55">Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary? And aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</verse>
				<verse number="56">And aren’t all his sisters here with us? Where did he get all this?”</verse>
				<verse number="57">And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.”</verse>
				<verse number="58">And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,</verse>
				<verse number="4">because John had repeatedly told him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they accepted John as a prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But on Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,</verse>
				<verse number="7">so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Instructed by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Although it grieved the king, because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.</verse>
				<verse number="11">His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When evening arrived, his disciples came to him saying, “This is an isolated place and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But he replied, “They don’t need to go. You give them something to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">They said to him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Bring them here to me,” he replied.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Not counting women and children, there were about five thousand men who ate.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dispersed the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Meanwhile the boat, already far from land, was taking a beating from the waves because the wind was against it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified and said, “It’s a ghost!” and cried out with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them: “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Peter said to him, “Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">So he said, “Come.” Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When the people there recognized him, they sent word into all the surrounding area, and they brought all their sick to him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">They begged him if they could only touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He answered them, “And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?</verse>
				<verse number="4">For God said, ‘ Honor your father and mother ’ and ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,”</verse>
				<verse number="6">he does not need to honor his father.’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said,</verse>
				<verse number="8">‘ This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then he called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.</verse>
				<verse number="11">What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this saying they were offended?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">And he replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer?</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.</verse>
				<verse number="20">These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="22">A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, “Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">So he answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” he said.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be done for you.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Jesus called the disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">The disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven — and a few small fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground,</verse>
				<verse number="36">he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Not counting children and women, there were four thousand men who ate.</verse>
				<verse number="39">After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Now when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said, “When evening comes you say, ‘It will be fair weather, because the sky is red,’</verse>
				<verse number="3">and in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, because the sky is red and darkening.’ You know how to judge correctly the appearance of the sky, but you cannot evaluate the signs of the times.</verse>
				<verse number="4">A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then he left them and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When the disciples went to the other side, they forgot to take bread.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“Watch out,” Jesus said to them, “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “It is because we brought no bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Jesus learned of this, he said, “You who have such little faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?</verse>
				<verse number="11">How could you not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then they understood that he had not told them to be on guard against the yeast in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">They answered, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And Jesus answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven!</verse>
				<verse number="18">And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="21">From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him: “God forbid, Lord! This must not happen to you!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them privately up a high mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Moses and Elijah also appeared before them, talking with him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, I will make three shelters — one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my one dear Son, in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the disciples heard this, they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Do not be afraid.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The disciples asked him, “Why then do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He answered, “Elijah does indeed come first and will restore all things.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When they came to the crowd, a man came to him, knelt before him,</verse>
				<verse number="15">and said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and into the water.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I brought him to your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring him here to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed from that moment.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He told them, “It was because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">***</verse>
				<verse number="22">When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they became greatly distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the double drachma tax, doesn’t he?”</verse>
				<verse number="25">He said, “Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect tolls or taxes — from their sons or from foreigners?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">After he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But so that we don’t offend them, go to the lake and throw out a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a four drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">He called a child, had him stand among them,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and said, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn around and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whoever then humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the open sea.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! It is necessary that stumbling blocks come, but woe to the person through whom they come.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into fiery hell.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“See that you do not disdain one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">***</verse>
				<verse number="12">What do you think? If someone owns a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go look for the one that went astray?</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that one of these little ones be lost.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“If your brother sins, go and show him his fault when the two of you are alone. If he listens to you, you have regained your brother.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, so that at the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, treat him like a Gentile or a tax collector.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Again, I tell you the truth, if two of you on earth agree about whatever you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For where two or three are assembled in my name, I am there among them.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Peter came to him and said, “Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother who sins against me? As many as seven times?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, I tell you, but seventy-seven times!</verse>
				<verse number="23">“For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="24">As he began settling his accounts, a man who owed ten thousand talents was brought to him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Because he was not able to repay it, the lord ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, children, and whatever he possessed, and repayment to be made.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then the slave threw himself to the ground before him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">The lord had compassion on that slave and released him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
				<verse number="28">After he went out, that same slave found one of his fellow slaves who owed him one hundred silver coins. So he grabbed him by the throat and started to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe me!’</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then his fellow slave threw himself down and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">But he refused. Instead, he went out and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were very upset and went and told their lord everything that had taken place.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then his lord called the first slave and said to him, ‘Evil slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Should you not have shown mercy to your fellow slave, just as I showed it to you?’</verse>
				<verse number="34">And in anger his lord turned him over to the prison guards to torture him until he repaid all he owed.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">Now when Jesus finished these sayings, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then some Pharisees came to him in order to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful to divorce a wife for any cause?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">He answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and said, ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh ’?</verse>
				<verse number="6">So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus said to them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but from the beginning it was not this way.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another commits adultery.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">The disciples said to him, “If this is the case of a husband with a wife, it is better not to marry!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to them, “Not everyone can accept this statement, except those to whom it has been given.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For there are some eunuchs who were that way from birth, and some who were made eunuchs by others, and some who became eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this should accept it.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then little children were brought to him for him to lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples scolded those who brought them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he placed his hands on them and went on his way.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now someone came up to him and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">He said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “ Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,</verse>
				<verse number="19">honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The young man said to him, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!</verse>
				<verse number="24">Again I say, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but for God all things are possible.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Peter said to him, “Look, we have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth: In the age when all things are renewed, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When it was about nine o’clock in the morning, he went out again and saw others standing around in the marketplace without work.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is right.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">So they went. When he went out again about noon and three o’clock that afternoon, he did the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And about five o’clock that afternoon he went out and found others standing around, and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day without work?’</verse>
				<verse number="7">They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go and work in the vineyard too.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give the pay starting with the last hired until the first.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">When those hired about five o’clock came, each received a full day’s pay.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each one also received the standard wage.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When they received it, they began to complain against the landowner,</verse>
				<verse number="12">saying, ‘These last fellows worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day.’</verse>
				<verse number="13">And the landowner replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me to work for the standard wage?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the last will be first, and the first last.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside privately and said to them on the way,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the experts in the law. They will condemn him to death,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged severely and crucified. Yet on the third day, he will be raised.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked him for a favor.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Permit these two sons of mine to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus answered, “You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He told them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right and at my left is not mine to give. Rather, it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now when the other ten heard this, they were angry with the two brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Jesus called them and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">It must not be this way among you! Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,</verse>
				<verse number="27">and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave —</verse>
				<verse number="28">just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Two blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The crowd scolded them to get them to be quiet. But they shouted even more loudly, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Now when they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="2">telling them, “Go to the village ahead of you. Right away you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“ Tell the people of Zion, ‘ Look, your king is coming to you, unassuming and seated on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The crowds that went ahead of him and those following kept shouting, “ Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">As he entered Jerusalem the whole city was thrown into an uproar, saying, “Who is this?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple courts, and turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And he said to them, “It is written, ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer, ’ but you are turning it into a den of robbers!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when the chief priests and the experts in the law saw the wonderful things he did and heard the children crying out in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant</verse>
				<verse number="16">and said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘ Out of the mouths of children and nursing infants you have prepared praise for yourself ’?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now early in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After noticing a fig tree by the road he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, “Never again will there be fruit from you!” And the fig tree withered at once.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When the disciples saw it they were amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus answered them, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Where did John’s baptism come from? From heaven or from people?” They discussed this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’</verse>
				<verse number="26">But if we say, ‘From people,’ we fear the crowd, for they all consider John to be a prophet.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Then he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">The boy answered, ‘I will not.’ But later he had a change of heart and went.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The father went to the other son and said the same thing. This boy answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Which of the two did his father’s will?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will go ahead of you into the kingdom of God!</verse>
				<verse number="32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe. Although you saw this, you did not later change your minds and believe him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When the harvest time was near, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his portion of the crop.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But the tenants seized his slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Again he sent other slaves, more than the first, and they treated them the same way.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and get his inheritance!’</verse>
				<verse number="39">So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">They said to him, “He will utterly destroy those evil men! Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures: ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes ’?</verse>
				<verse number="43">For this reason I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.</verse>
				<verse number="44">The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them.</verse>
				<verse number="46">They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the crowds regarded him as a prophet.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the banquet, but they would not come.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look! The feast I have prepared for you is ready. My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.”’</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The rest seized his slaves, insolently mistreated them, and killed them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The king was furious! He sent his soldiers, and they put those murderers to death and set their city on fire.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but the ones who had been invited were not worthy.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But when the king came in to see the wedding guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But he had nothing to say.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’</verse>
				<verse number="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Pharisees went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They sent to him their disciples along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not court anyone’s favor because you show no partiality.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Show me the coin used for the tax.” So they brought him a denarius.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">They replied, “Caesar’s.” He said to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now when they heard this they were stunned, and they left him and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The same day Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to him and asked him,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Teacher, Moses said, ‘ If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and father children for his brother.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The second did the same, and the third, down to the seventh.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Last of all, the woman died.</verse>
				<verse number="28">In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus answered them, “You are deceived, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Now as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God,</verse>
				<verse number="32">‘ I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living!”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled together.</verse>
				<verse number="35">And one of them, an expert in religious law, asked him a question to test him:</verse>
				<verse number="36">“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jesus said to him, “‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">This is the first and greatest commandment.</verse>
				<verse number="39">The second is like it: ‘ Love your neighbor as yourself.’</verse>
				<verse number="40">All the law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question:</verse>
				<verse number="42">“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said, “The son of David.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">He said to them, “How then does David by the Spirit call him ‘Lord,’ saying,</verse>
				<verse number="44">‘ The Lord said to my lord, “ Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet ”’?</verse>
				<verse number="45">If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</verse>
				<verse number="46">No one was able to answer him a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him any longer.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“The experts in the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore pay attention to what they tell you and do it. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they teach.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They tie up heavy loads, hard to carry, and put them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing even to lift a finger to move them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They do all their deeds to be seen by people, for they make their phylacteries wide and their tassels long.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues</verse>
				<verse number="7">and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces, and to have people call them ‘Rabbi.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And call no one your ‘father’ on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for you have one teacher, the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The greatest among you will be your servant.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“But woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You keep locking people out of the kingdom of heaven! For you neither enter nor permit those trying to enter to go in.</verse>
				<verse number="14">***</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to make one convert, and when you get one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by the oath.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">Blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</verse>
				<verse number="18">And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by the oath.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">You are blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</verse>
				<verse number="20">So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and the one who sits on it.</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin, yet you neglect what is more important in the law — justice, mercy, and faithfulness! You should have done these things without neglecting the others.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Blind guides! You strain out a gnat yet swallow a camel!</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside may become clean too!</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="28">In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">By saying this you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Fill up then the measure of your ancestors!</verse>
				<verse number="33">You snakes, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?</verse>
				<verse number="34">“For this reason I am sending you prophets and wise men and experts in the law, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town,</verse>
				<verse number="35">so that on you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="36">I tell you the truth, this generation will be held responsible for all these things!</verse>
				<verse number="37">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would have none of it!</verse>
				<verse number="38">Look, your house is left to you desolate!</verse>
				<verse number="39">For I tell you, you will not see me from now until you say, ‘ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! ’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away, his disciples came to show him the temple buildings.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And he said to them, “Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one misleads you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will mislead many.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Make sure that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is still to come.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All these things are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations because of my name.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then many will be led into sin, and they will betray one another and hate one another.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And many false prophets will appear and deceive many,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and because lawlessness will increase so much, the love of many will grow cold.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the person who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole inhabited earth as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“So when you see the abomination of desolation — spoken about by Daniel the prophet — standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),</verse>
				<verse number="16">then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The one on the roof must not come down to take anything out of his house,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For then there will be great suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the world until now, or ever will happen.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Remember, I have told you ahead of time.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So then, if someone says to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For just like the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Immediately after the suffering of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, right at the door.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
				<verse number="36">“But as for that day and hour no one knows it — not even the angels in heaven — except the Father alone.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For just like the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.</verse>
				<verse number="38">For in those days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away. It will be the same at the coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.</verse>
				<verse number="41">There will be two women grinding grain with a mill; one will be taken and one left.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“Therefore stay alert, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been alert and would not have let his house be broken into.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Therefore you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the other slaves their food at the proper time?</verse>
				<verse number="46">Blessed is that slave whom the master finds at work when he comes.</verse>
				<verse number="47">I tell you the truth, the master will put him in charge of all his possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="48">But if that evil slave should say to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’</verse>
				<verse number="49">and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with drunkards,</verse>
				<verse number="50">then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee,</verse>

			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Five of the virgins were foolish, and five were wise.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the foolish ones took their lamps, they did not take extra olive oil with them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But the wise ones took flasks of olive oil with their lamps.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When the bridegroom was delayed a long time, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is here! Come out to meet him.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">‘No,’ they replied. ‘There won’t be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">But while they had gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Later, the other virgins came too, saying, ‘Lord, lord! Let us in!’</verse>
				<verse number="12">But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I do not know you!’</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“For it is like a man going on a journey, who summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work and gained five more.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the same way, the one who had two gained two more.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled his accounts with them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, saying, ‘Sir, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">His master answered, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful in a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">The one with the two talents also came and said, ‘Sir, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">His master answered, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then the one who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed,</verse>
				<verse number="25">so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">But his master answered, ‘Evil and lazy slave! So you knew that I harvest where I didn’t sow and gather where I didn’t scatter?</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received my money back with interest!</verse>
				<verse number="28">Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For the one who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And throw that worthless slave into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</verse>
				<verse number="32">All the nations will be assembled before him, and he will separate people one from another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,</verse>
				<verse number="36">I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?</verse>
				<verse number="38">When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or naked and clothe you?</verse>
				<verse number="39">When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</verse>
				<verse number="40">And the king will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of mine, you did it for me.’</verse>
				<verse number="41">“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!</verse>
				<verse number="42">For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then they too will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not give you whatever you needed?’</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then he will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for me.’</verse>
				<verse number="46">And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</verse>

			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they said, “Not during the feast, so that there won’t be a riot among the people.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
				<verse number="7">a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfumed oil, and she poured it on his head as he was at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When the disciples saw this, they became indignant and said, “Why this waste?</verse>
				<verse number="9">It could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When Jesus learned of this, he said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good service for me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!</verse>
				<verse number="12">When she poured this oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
				<verse number="15">and said, “What will you give me to betray him into your hands?” So they set out thirty silver coins for him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">He said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When it was evening, he took his place at the table with the twelve.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And while they were eating he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">They became greatly distressed and each one began to say to him, “Surely not I, Lord?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus replied, “You have said it yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,</verse>
				<verse number="28">for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I tell you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: ‘ I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’</verse>
				<verse number="32">But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Peter said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.” And all the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “So, couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour?</verse>
				<verse number="41">Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.</verse>
				<verse number="44">So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="48">(Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!”)</verse>
				<verse number="49">Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
				<verse number="51">But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?</verse>
				<verse number="54">How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?”</verse>
				<verse number="55">At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me.</verse>
				<verse number="56">But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered.</verse>
				<verse number="58">But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. After going in, he sat with the guards to see the outcome.</verse>
				<verse number="59">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.</verse>
				<verse number="60">But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward</verse>
				<verse number="61">and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”</verse>
				<verse number="62">So the high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?”</verse>
				<verse number="63">But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="64">Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Now you have heard the blasphemy!</verse>
				<verse number="66">What is your verdict?” They answered, “He is guilty and deserves death.”</verse>
				<verse number="67">Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him,</verse>
				<verse number="68">saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who hit you?”</verse>
				<verse number="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A slave girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
				<verse number="70">But he denied it in front of them all: “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</verse>
				<verse number="71">When he went out to the gateway, another slave girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</verse>
				<verse number="72">He denied it again with an oath, “I do not know the man!”</verse>
				<verse number="73">After a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said, “You really are one of them too — even your accent gives you away!”</verse>
				<verse number="74">At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment a rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="75">Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
				<verse number="4">saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “ They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="16">At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)</verse>
				<verse number="19">As he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man; I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream about him today.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. You take care of it yourselves!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">In reply all the people said, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort around him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him,</verse>
				<verse number="29">and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand, and kneeling down before him, they mocked him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They spat on him and took the staff and struck him repeatedly on the head.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry his cross.</verse>
				<verse number="33">They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”)</verse>
				<verse number="34">and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he would not drink it.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then they sat down and kept guard over him there.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Above his head they put the charge against him, which read: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads</verse>
				<verse number="40">and saying, “You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">In the same way even the chief priests — together with the experts in the law and elders — were mocking him:</verse>
				<verse number="42">“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel! If he comes down now from the cross, we will believe in him!</verse>
				<verse number="43">H e trusts in God — let God, if he wants to, deliver him now because he said, ‘I am God’s Son’!”</verse>
				<verse number="44">The robbers who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Now from noon until three, darkness came over all the land.</verse>
				<verse number="46">At about three o’clock Jesus shouted with a loud voice, “ Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? ” that is, “ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
				<verse number="47">When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.</verse>
				<verse number="49">But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Just then the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks were split apart.</verse>
				<verse number="52">And tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.</verse>
				<verse number="53">(They came out of the tombs after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.)</verse>
				<verse number="54">Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place, they were extremely terrified and said, “Truly this one was God’s Son!”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a distance.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</verse>
				<verse number="59">Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
				<verse number="60">and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="61">(Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the tomb.)</verse>
				<verse number="62">The next day (which is after the day of preparation) the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate</verse>
				<verse number="63">and said, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’</verse>
				<verse number="64">So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</verse>
				<verse number="65">Pilate said to them, “Take a guard of soldiers. Go and make it as secure as you can.”</verse>
				<verse number="66">So they went with the soldiers of the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it.</verse>
				<verse number="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Listen, I have told you!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They came to him, held on to his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
				<verse number="13">telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were asleep.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">If this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then Jesus came up and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="20">teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</verse>

				<verse number="3">the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight. ’”</verse>
				<verse number="4">In the wilderness John the baptizer began preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="5">People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="6">John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He proclaimed, “One more powerful than I am is coming after me; I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</verse>

				<verse number="9">Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And a voice came from heaven: “You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He was in the wilderness forty days, enduring temptations from Satan. He was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the gospel!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">They left their nets immediately and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their boat mending nets.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The people there were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority, not like the experts in the law.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">They were all amazed so that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now as soon as they left the synagogue, they entered Simon and Andrew’s house, with James and John.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so they spoke to Jesus at once about her.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="32">When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The whole town gathered by the door.</verse>
				<verse number="34">So he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Simon and his companions searched for him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">He replied, “Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out here to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help. “If you are willing, you can make me clean,” he said.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning.</verse>
				<verse number="44">He told him, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. Still they kept coming to him from everywhere.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now after some days, when he returned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds:</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’?</verse>
				<verse number="10">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” — he said to the paralytic —</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">And immediately the man stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. And he got up and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast.</verse>
				<verse number="21">No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?”</verse>
				<verse number="25">He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry —</verse>
				<verse number="26">how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread, which is against the law for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to his companions?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For this reason the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up among all these people.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or evil, to save a life or destroy it?” But they were silent.</verse>
				<verse number="5">After looking around at them in anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians, as to how they could assassinate him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him. And from Judea,</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they came to him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He appointed twelve (whom he named apostles ), so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach</verse>
				<verse number="15">and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He appointed twelve: To Simon he gave the name Peter;</verse>
				<verse number="17">to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, he gave the name Boanerges (that is, “sons of thunder”);</verse>
				<verse number="18">and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So he called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
				<verse number="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom will not be able to stand.</verse>
				<verse number="25">If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And if Satan rises against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand and his end has come.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can thoroughly plunder his house.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I tell you the truth, people will be forgiven for all sins, even all the blasphemies they utter.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin ”</verse>
				<verse number="30">(because they said, “He has an unclean spirit” ).</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, to summon him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
				<verse number="35">For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,</verse>
				<verse number="12">so that although they look they may look but not see, and although they hear they may hear but not understand, so they may not repent and be forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable?</verse>
				<verse number="14">The sower sows the word.</verse>
				<verse number="15">These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand?</verse>
				<verse number="22">For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</verse>
				<verse number="28">By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it?</verse>
				<verse number="31">It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground —</verse>
				<verse number="32">when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="35">On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he cried out with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God — do not torment me!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">(For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!” )</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region.</verse>
				<verse number="11">There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And the demonic spirits begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the one who had the “Legion” — and they were afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, “Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He asked him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.</verse>
				<verse number="26">She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</verse>
				<verse number="28">for she kept saying, “If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</verse>
				<verse number="38">They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When he entered he said to them, “Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">And they began making fun of him. But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “ Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this.</verse>
				<verse number="43">He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he get these ideas? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these miracles that are done through his hands?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And so they took offense at him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff — no bread, no bag, no money in their belts —</verse>
				<verse number="9">and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If a place will not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">So they went out and preached that all should repent.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now King Herod heard this, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For John had repeatedly told Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not</verse>
				<verse number="20">because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him, since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him, he was thoroughly baffled, and yet he liked to listen to John.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But a suitable day came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He swore to her, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother said, “The head of John the baptizer.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Although it grieved the king deeply, he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When John’s disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</verse>
				<verse number="31">He said to them, “Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while” (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat).</verse>
				<verse number="32">So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived there ahead of them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them many things.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When it was already late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is an isolated place and it is already very late.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said, “Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins and give it to them to eat?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five — and two fish.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples to serve the people, and he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
				<verse number="42">They all ate and were satisfied,</verse>
				<verse number="43">and they picked up the broken pieces and fish that were left over, twelve baskets full.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Now there were five thousand men who ate the bread.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dispersed the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="46">After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.</verse>
				<verse number="48">He saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. As the night was ending, he came to them walking on the sea, for he wanted to pass by them.</verse>
				<verse number="49">When they saw him walking on the water they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</verse>
				<verse number="50">for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them: “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">Then he went up with them into the boat, and the wind ceased. They were completely astonished,</verse>
				<verse number="52">because they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</verse>
				<verse number="53">After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
				<verse number="54">As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="55">They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be.</verse>
				<verse number="56">And wherever he would go — into villages, towns, or countryside — they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and would ask him if they could just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed.</verse>
				<verse number="3">(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing, holding fast to the tradition of the elders.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches. )</verse>
				<verse number="5">The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘ This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Having no regard for the command of God, you hold fast to human tradition.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">He also said to them, “You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For Moses said, ‘ Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is corban ’ (that is, a gift for God),</verse>
				<verse number="12">then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand.</verse>
				<verse number="15">There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">***</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He said to them, “Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?</verse>
				<verse number="19">For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer.” (This means all foods are clean.)</verse>
				<verse number="20">He said, “What comes out of a person defiles him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder,</verse>
				<verse number="22">adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly.</verse>
				<verse number="23">All these evils come from within and defile a person.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">She answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then he said to her, “Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, “ Ephphatha ” (that is, “Be opened” ).</verse>
				<verse number="35">And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jesus ordered them not to tell anything. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more.</verse>
				<verse number="37">People were completely astounded and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="2">“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days, and they have nothing to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from a great distance.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">His disciples answered him, “Where can someone get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy these people?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. After he took the seven loaves and gave thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples to serve. So they served the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They also had a few small fish. After giving thanks for these, he told them to serve these as well.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There were about four thousand who ate. Then he dismissed them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, asking for a sign from heaven to test him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Sighing deeply in his spirit he said, “Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to this generation.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now they had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And Jesus ordered them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When he learned of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you arguing about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Though you have eyes, don’t you see? And though you have ears, can’t you hear? Don’t you remember?</verse>
				<verse number="19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Twelve.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">“When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Seven.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he said to them, “Do you still not understand?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village. Then he spit on his eyes, placed his hands on his eyes and asked, “Do you see anything?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Regaining his sight he said, “I see people, but they look like trees walking.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">They said, “John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He spoke openly about this. So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But after turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.</verse>
				<verse number="36">For what benefit is it for a person to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his life?</verse>
				<verse number="37">What can a person give in exchange for his life?</verse>
				<verse number="38">For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">And he said to them, “I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and his clothes became radiantly white, more so than any launderer in the world could bleach them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters — one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(For they were afraid, and he did not know what to say.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my one dear Son. Listen to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more except Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They kept this statement to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they asked him, “Why do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">He said to them, “Elijah does indeed come first, and restores all things. And why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised?</verse>
				<verse number="13">But I tell you that Elijah has certainly come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law arguing with them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran at once and greeted him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">A member of the crowd said to him, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able to do so.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">He answered them, “You unbelieving generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring him to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood.</verse>
				<verse number="22">It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">It shrieked, threw him into terrible convulsions, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He is dead!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then, after he went into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">He told them, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They went out from there and passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,</verse>
				<verse number="31">for he was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But they did not understand this statement and were afraid to ask him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then they came to Capernaum. After Jesus was inside the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="35">After he sat down, he called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not following us.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, because no one who does a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say anything bad about me.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
				<verse number="41">For I tell you the truth, whoever gives you a cup of water because you bear Christ’s name will never lose his reward.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone tied around his neck and to be thrown into the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="43">If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell, to the unquenchable fire.</verse>
				<verse number="44">***</verse>
				<verse number="45">If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</verse>
				<verse number="46">***</verse>
				<verse number="47">If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</verse>
				<verse number="48">where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Everyone will be salted with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan River. Again crowds gathered to him, and again, as was his custom, he taught them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But from the beginning of creation he made them male and female.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">In the house once again, the disciples asked him about this.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So he told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now people were bringing little children to him for him to touch, but the disciples scolded those who brought them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">After he took the children in his arms, he placed his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now as Jesus was starting out on his way, someone ran up to him, fell on his knees, and said, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You know the commandments: ‘ Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The man said to him, “Teacher, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">As Jesus looked at him, he felt love for him and said, “You lack one thing. Go, sell whatever you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But at this statement, the man looked sad and went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="24">The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
				<verse number="25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but not for God; all things are possible for God.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Peter began to speak to him, “Look, we have left everything to follow you!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel</verse>
				<verse number="30">who will not receive in this age a hundred times as much — homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, fields, all with persecutions — and in the age to come, eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem. Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="34">They will mock him, spit on him, flog him severely, and kill him. Yet after three days, he will rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">They said to him, “Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">But Jesus said to them, “You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">They said to him, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I experience,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Now when the other ten heard this, they became angry with James and John.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But it is not this way among you. Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,</verse>
				<verse number="44">and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all.</verse>
				<verse number="45">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Many scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage! Get up! He is calling you.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">He threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man replied, “Rabbi, let me see again.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the road.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now as they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples</verse>
				<verse number="2">and said to them, “Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here soon.’”</verse>
				<verse number="4">So they went and found a colt tied at a door, outside in the street, and untied it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Some people standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying that colt?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">They replied as Jesus had told them, and the bystanders let them go.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then they brought the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Both those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting, “ Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. And after looking around at everything, he went out to Bethany with the twelve since it was already late.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now the next day, as they went out from Bethany, he was hungry.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After noticing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. When he came to it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then they came to Jerusalem. Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying in the temple courts. He turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he began to teach them and said, “Is it not written: ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ’? But you have turned it into a den of robbers!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">The chief priests and the experts in the law heard it and they considered how they could assassinate him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed by his teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus said to them, “Have faith in God.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I tell you the truth, if someone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For this reason I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">***</verse>
				<verse number="27">They came again to Jerusalem. While Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the experts in the law, and the elders came up to him</verse>
				<verse number="28">and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:</verse>
				<verse number="30">John’s baptism — was it from heaven or from people? Answer me.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">They discussed with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’</verse>
				<verse number="32">But if we say, ‘From people — ’” (they feared the crowd, for they all considered John to be truly a prophet).</verse>
				<verse number="33">So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Then he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey.</verse>
				<verse number="2">At harvest time he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his portion of the crop.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But those tenants seized his slave, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So he sent another slave to them again. This one they struck on the head and treated outrageously.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He sent another, and that one they killed. This happened to many others, some of whom were beaten, others killed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He had one left, his one dear son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">So they seized him, killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.</verse>
				<verse number="9">What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Have you not read this scripture: ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes ’?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now they wanted to arrest him (but they feared the crowd), because they realized that he told this parable against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When they came they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and do not court anyone’s favor, because you show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn’t we?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But he saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they brought one, and he said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?” They replied, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were utterly amazed at him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) also came to him and asked him,</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Teacher, Moses wrote for us: ‘ If a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">There were seven brothers. The first one married, and when he died he had no children.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The second married her and died without any children, and likewise the third.</verse>
				<verse number="22">None of the seven had children. Finally, the woman died too.</verse>
				<verse number="23">In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you deceived for this reason, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
				<verse number="25">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Now as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, ‘ I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ’?</verse>
				<verse number="27">He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now one of the experts in the law came and heard them debating. When he saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus answered, “The most important is: ‘ Listen, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">The second is: ‘ Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The expert in the law said to him, “That is true, Teacher; you are right to say that he is one, and there is no one else besides him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And to love him with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">When Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” Then no one dared any longer to question him.</verse>
				<verse number="35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, “How is it that the experts in the law say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
				<verse number="36">David himself, by the Holy Spirit, said, ‘ The Lord said to my lord, “ Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’</verse>
				<verse number="37">If David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.</verse>
				<verse number="38">In his teaching Jesus also said, “Watch out for the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces,</verse>
				<verse number="39">and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
				<verse number="40">They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. These men will receive a more severe punishment.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then he sat down opposite the offering box, and watched the crowd putting coins into it. Many rich people were throwing in large amounts.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny.</verse>
				<verse number="43">He called his disciples and said to them, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others.</verse>
				<verse number="44">For they all gave out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in what she had to live on, everything she had.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look at these tremendous stones and buildings!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to take place?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out that no one misleads you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will mislead many.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines. These are but the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“You must watch out for yourselves. You will be handed over to councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">First the gospel must be preached to all nations.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When they arrest you and hand you over for trial, do not worry about what to speak. But say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents and have them put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="13">You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The one on the roof must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Pray that it may not be in winter.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For in those days there will be suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, or ever will happen.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved. But because of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut them short.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe him.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the elect.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Be careful! I have told you everything ahead of time.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“But in those days, after that suffering, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light;</verse>
				<verse number="25">the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then everyone will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then he will send angels and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, right at the door.</verse>
				<verse number="30">I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“But as for that day or hour no one knows it — neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son — except the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Watch out! Stay alert! For you do not know when the time will come.</verse>
				<verse number="34">It is like a man going on a journey. He left his house and put his slaves in charge, assigning to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to stay alert.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Stay alert, then, because you do not know when the owner of the house will return — whether during evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn —</verse>
				<verse number="36">or else he might find you asleep when he returns suddenly.</verse>
				<verse number="37">What I say to you I say to everyone: Stay alert!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For they said, “Not during the feast, so there won’t be a riot among the people.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of costly aromatic oil from pure nard. After breaking open the jar, she poured it on his head.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But some who were present indignantly said to one another, “Why this waste of expensive ointment?</verse>
				<verse number="5">It could have been sold for more than three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor!” So they spoke angrily to her.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a good service for me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For you will always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want. But you will not always have me!</verse>
				<verse number="8">She did what she could. She anointed my body beforehand for burial.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus into their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">He sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’</verse>
				<verse number="15">He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the disciples left, went into the city, and found things just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then, when it was evening, he came to the house with the twelve.</verse>
				<verse number="18">While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, one of you eating with me will betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">They were distressed, and one by one said to him, “Surely not I?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who dips his hand with me into the bowl.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For the Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">While they were eating, he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take it. This is my body.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He said to them, “This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I tell you the truth, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘ I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, I will not!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, today — this very night — before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.” And all of them said the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">He took Peter, James, and John with him, and became very troubled and distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay alert.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Going a little farther, he threw himself to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour would pass from him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you stay awake for one hour?</verse>
				<verse number="38">Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">He went away again and prayed the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="40">When he came again he found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open. And they did not know what to tell him.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He came a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough of that! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Right away, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him came a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and experts in the law and elders.</verse>
				<verse number="44">(Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him and lead him away under guard.”)</verse>
				<verse number="45">When Judas arrived, he went up to Jesus immediately and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Then they took hold of him and arrested him.</verse>
				<verse number="47">One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Jesus said to them, “Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?</verse>
				<verse number="49">Day after day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me. But this has happened so that the scriptures would be fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
				<verse number="51">A young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth. They tried to arrest him,</verse>
				<verse number="52">but he ran off naked, leaving his linen cloth behind.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together.</verse>
				<verse number="54">And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the high priest’s courtyard. He was sitting with the guards and warming himself by the fire.</verse>
				<verse number="55">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</verse>
				<verse number="58">“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.’”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree.</verse>
				<verse number="60">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?”</verse>
				<verse number="61">But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”</verse>
				<verse number="62">“I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="63">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?</verse>
				<verse number="64">You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict?” They all condemned him as deserving death.</verse>
				<verse number="65">Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to strike him with their fists, saying, “Prophesy!” The guards also took him and beat him.</verse>
				<verse number="66">Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s slave girls came by.</verse>
				<verse number="67">When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said, “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="68">But he denied it: “I don’t even understand what you’re talking about!” Then he went out to the gateway, and a rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="69">When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”</verse>
				<verse number="70">But he denied it again. A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter, “You must be one of them, because you are also a Galilean.”</verse>
				<verse number="71">Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know this man you are talking about!”</verse>
				<verse number="72">Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Early in the morning, after forming a plan, the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied, “You say so.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the chief priests began to accuse him repeatedly.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Pilate asked him again, “Have you nothing to say? See how many charges they are bringing against you!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">During the feast it was customary to release one prisoner to the people, whomever they requested.</verse>
				<verse number="7">A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them, as was his custom.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">(For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas instead.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So Pilate spoke to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">They shouted back, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then, after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the soldiers led him into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They put a purple cloak on him and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They began to salute him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Then they knelt down and paid homage to him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they had finished mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The soldiers forced a passerby to carry his cross, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country (he was the father of Alexander and Rufus).</verse>
				<verse number="22">They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which is translated, “Place of the Skull”).</verse>
				<verse number="23">They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, throwing dice for them, to decide what each would take.</verse>
				<verse number="25">It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The inscription of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">And they crucified two outlaws with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
				<verse number="28">***</verse>
				<verse number="29">Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,</verse>
				<verse number="30">save yourself and come down from the cross!”</verse>
				<verse number="31">In the same way even the chief priests — together with the experts in the law — were mocking him among themselves: “He saved others, but he cannot save himself!</verse>
				<verse number="32">Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now, that we may see and believe!” Those who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now when it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Around three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “ Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? ” which means, “ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? ”</verse>
				<verse number="35">When some of the bystanders heard it they said, “Listen, he is calling for Elijah!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Then someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to take him down!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw how he died, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">There were also women, watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</verse>
				<verse number="41">When he was in Galilee, they had followed him and given him support. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Now when evening had already come, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath),</verse>
				<verse number="43">Joseph of Arimathea, a highly regarded member of the council, who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time.</verse>
				<verse number="45">When Pilate was informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
				<verse number="46">After Joseph bought a linen cloth and took down the body, he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone across the entrance of the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was placed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And very early on the first day of the week, at sunrise, they went to the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They had been asking each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled back.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then as they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has been raised! He is not here. Look, there is the place where they laid him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But go, tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then they went out and ran from the tomb, for terror and bewilderment had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. [[</verse>
				<verse number="9">Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</verse>
				<verse number="10">She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>
				<verse number="17">These signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;</verse>
				<verse number="18">they will pick up snakes with their hands, and whatever poison they drink will not harm them; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be well.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">They went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.]]</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Now many have undertaken to compile an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
				<verse number="2">like the accounts passed on to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So it seemed good to me as well, because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
				<verse number="4">so that you may know for certain the things you were taught.</verse>
				<verse number="5">During the reign of Herod king of Judea, there lived a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and he had a wife named Elizabeth, who was a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They were both righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both very old.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now while Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,</verse>
				<verse number="9">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the holy place of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now the whole crowd of people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.</verse>
				<verse number="11">An angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense, appeared to him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And Zechariah, visibly shaken when he saw the angel, was seized with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son; you will name him John.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Joy and gladness will come to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,</verse>
				<verse number="15">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And he will go as forerunner before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is old as well.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they began to wonder why he was delayed in the holy place.</verse>
				<verse number="22">When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the holy place, because he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When his time of service was over, he went to his home.</verse>
				<verse number="24">After some time his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she kept herself in seclusion. She said,</verse>
				<verse number="25">“This is what the Lord has done for me at the time when he has been gracious to me, to take away my disgrace among people.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
				<verse number="27">to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">But she was greatly troubled by his words and began to wonder about the meaning of this greeting.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God!</verse>
				<verse number="31">Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="36">“And look, your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant with a son in her old age — although she was called barren, she is now in her sixth month!</verse>
				<verse number="37">For nothing will be impossible with God.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">So Mary said, “Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</verse>
				<verse number="39">In those days Mary got up and went hurriedly into the hill country, to a town of Judah,</verse>
				<verse number="40">and entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
				<verse number="41">When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="42">She exclaimed with a loud voice, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child in your womb!</verse>
				<verse number="43">And who am I that the mother of my Lord should come and visit me?</verse>
				<verse number="44">For the instant the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
				<verse number="45">And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">And Mary said, “My soul exalts the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="47">and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior,</verse>
				<verse number="48">because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant. For from now on all generations will call me blessed,</verse>
				<verse number="49">because he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name;</verse>
				<verse number="50">from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.</verse>
				<verse number="51">He has demonstrated power with his arm; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="52">He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position;</verse>
				<verse number="53">he has filled the hungry with good things, and has sent the rich away empty.</verse>
				<verse number="54">He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy,</verse>
				<verse number="55">as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="56">So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her home.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Now the time came for Elizabeth to have her baby, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
				<verse number="58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
				<verse number="59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they wanted to name him Zechariah after his father.</verse>
				<verse number="60">But his mother replied, “No! He must be named John.”</verse>
				<verse number="61">They said to her, “But none of your relatives bears this name.”</verse>
				<verse number="62">So they made signs to the baby’s father, inquiring what he wanted to name his son.</verse>
				<verse number="63">He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="64">Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue released, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
				<verse number="65">All their neighbors were filled with fear, and throughout the entire hill country of Judea all these things were talked about.</verse>
				<verse number="66">All who heard these things kept them in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the Lord’s hand was indeed with him.</verse>
				<verse number="67">Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,</verse>
				<verse number="68">“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he has come to help and has redeemed his people.</verse>
				<verse number="69">For he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,</verse>
				<verse number="70">as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago,</verse>
				<verse number="71">that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us.</verse>
				<verse number="72">He has done this to show mercy to our ancestors, and to remember his holy covenant —</verse>
				<verse number="73">the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham. This oath grants</verse>
				<verse number="74">that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, may serve him without fear,</verse>
				<verse number="75">in holiness and righteousness before him for as long as we live.</verse>
				<verse number="76">And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High. For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
				<verse number="77">to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins.</verse>
				<verse number="78">Because of our God’s tender mercy the dawn will break upon us from on high</verse>
				<verse number="79">to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="80">And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he was revealed to Israel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Everyone went to his own town to be registered.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He went to be registered with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him, and who was expecting a child.</verse>
				<verse number="6">While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night.</verse>
				<verse number="9">An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were absolutely terrified.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! Listen carefully, for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people:</verse>
				<verse number="11">Today your Savior is born in the city of David. He is Christ the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">This will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Suddenly a vast, heavenly army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</verse>
				<verse number="14">“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, that the Lord has made known to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph, and found the baby lying in a manger.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When they saw him, they related what they had been told about this child,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering in her heart what they might mean.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; everything was just as they had been told.</verse>
				<verse number="21">At the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
				<verse number="23">(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “ Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord ” ),</verse>
				<verse number="24">and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, a pair of doves or two young pigeons.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout, looking for the restoration of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="27">So Simeon, directed by the Spirit, came into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law,</verse>
				<verse number="28">Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Now, according to your word, Sovereign Lord, permit your servant to depart in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For my eyes have seen your salvation</verse>
				<verse number="31">that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:</verse>
				<verse number="32">a light, for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Listen carefully: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Indeed, as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed — and a sword will pierce your own soul as well!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having been married to her husband for seven years until his death.</verse>
				<verse number="37">She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.</verse>
				<verse number="38">At that moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of the Passover.</verse>
				<verse number="42">When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</verse>
				<verse number="44">but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances.</verse>
				<verse number="45">When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.</verse>
				<verse number="46">After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
				<verse number="47">And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
				<verse number="48">When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">But he replied, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
				<verse number="52">And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
				<verse number="2">during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He went into all the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one shouting in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low, and the crooked will be made straight, and the rough ways will be made smooth,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and all humanity will see the salvation of God.’”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance, and don’t begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the crowds were asking him, “What then should we do?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">John answered them, “The person who has two tunics must share with the person who has none, and the person who has food must do likewise.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">He told them, “Collect no more than you are required to.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then some soldiers also asked him, “And as for us — what should we do?” He told them, “Take money from no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your pay.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">While the people were filled with anticipation and they all wondered whether perhaps John could be the Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="16">John answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming — I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
				<verse number="17">His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">And in this way, with many other exhortations, John proclaimed good news to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil deeds that he had done,</verse>
				<verse number="20">Herod added this to them all: He locked up John in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. And while he was praying, the heavens opened,</verse>
				<verse number="22">and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years old. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,</verse>
				<verse number="24">the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</verse>
				<verse number="25">the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</verse>
				<verse number="26">the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,</verse>
				<verse number="27">the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</verse>
				<verse number="28">the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,</verse>
				<verse number="29">the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</verse>
				<verse number="30">the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,</verse>
				<verse number="31">the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</verse>
				<verse number="32">the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon,</verse>
				<verse number="33">the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</verse>
				<verse number="34">the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</verse>
				<verse number="35">the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</verse>
				<verse number="36">the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</verse>
				<verse number="37">the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,</verse>
				<verse number="38">the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,</verse>
				<verse number="2">where for forty days he endured temptations from the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, he was famished.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘ Man does not live by bread alone.’”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in a flash all the kingdoms of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And he said to him, “To you I will grant this whole realm — and the glory that goes along with it, for it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So then, if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘ You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the devil brought him to Jerusalem, had him stand on the highest point of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,</verse>
				<verse number="10">for it is written, ‘ He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,’</verse>
				<verse number="11">and ‘ with their hands they will lift you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘ You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until a more opportune time.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus, in the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and news about him spread throughout the surrounding countryside.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by all.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,</verse>
				<verse number="18">“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and the regaining of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed,</verse>
				<verse number="19">to proclaim the year of the Lord ’ s favor.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he began to tell them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled even as you heard it being read.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">All were speaking well of him, and were amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth. They said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus said to them, “No doubt you will quote to me the proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ and say, ‘What we have heard that you did in Capernaum, do here in your hometown too.’”</verse>
				<verse number="24">And he added, “I tell you the truth, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the sky was shut up three and a half years, and there was a great famine over all the land.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to a woman who was a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When they heard this, all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They got up, forced him out of the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But he passed through the crowd and went on his way.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he began to teach the people.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” Then, after the demon threw the man down in their midst, he came out of him without hurting him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">They were all amazed and began to say to one another, “What’s happening here? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">So the news about him spread into all areas of the region.</verse>
				<verse number="38">After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So he stood over her, commanded the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them.</verse>
				<verse number="40">As the sun was setting, all those who had any relatives sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus. He placed his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Demons also came out of many, crying out, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="42">The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place. Yet the crowds were seeking him, and they came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But Jesus said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, for that is what I was sent to do.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing around him to hear the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will lower the nets.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets started to tear.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they were about to sink.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">For Peter and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s business partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came to him who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he bowed down with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he ordered the man to tell no one, but commanded him, “Go and show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the news about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering together to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yet Jesus himself frequently withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now on one of those days, while he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby (who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem), and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Just then some men showed up, carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But since they found no way to carry him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on the stretcher through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When Jesus saw their faith he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to think to themselves, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you raising objections within yourselves?</verse>
				<verse number="23">Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?</verse>
				<verse number="24">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” — he said to the paralyzed man — “I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher and go home.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Immediately he stood up before them, picked up the stretcher he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then astonishment seized them all, and they glorified God. They were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen incredible things today.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And he got up and followed him, leaving everything behind.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Levi gave a great banquet in his house for Jesus, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But the Pharisees and their experts in the law complained to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus answered them, “Those who are well don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then they said to him, “John’s disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours continue to eat and drink.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">So Jesus said to them, “You cannot make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?</verse>
				<verse number="35">But those days are coming, and when the bridegroom is taken from them, at that time they will fast.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">He also told them a parable: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, he will have torn the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
				<verse number="37">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Instead new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</verse>
				<verse number="39">No one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples picked some heads of wheat, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry —</verse>
				<verse number="4">how he entered the house of God, took and ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching. Now a man was there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could find a reason to accuse him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand here.” So he rose and stood there.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">After looking around at them all, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But they were filled with mindless rage and began debating with one another what they would do to Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now it was during this time that Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent all night in prayer to God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When morning came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles:</verse>
				<verse number="14">Simon (whom he named Peter), and his brother Andrew; and James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,</verse>
				<verse number="15">Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,</verse>
				<verse number="16">Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he came down with them and stood on a level place. And a large number of his disciples had gathered along with a vast multitude from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and those who suffered from unclean spirits were cured.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The whole crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing them all.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he looked up at his disciples and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for the kingdom of God belongs to you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. “Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject you as evil on account of the Son of Man!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Rejoice in that day, and jump for joy, because your reward is great in heaven. For their ancestors did the same things to the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your comfort already.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Woe to you who are well satisfied with food now, for you will be hungry. “Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.</verse>
				<verse number="26">“Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</verse>
				<verse number="28">bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</verse>
				<verse number="29">To the person who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other as well, and from the person who takes away your coat, do not withhold your tunic either.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your possessions back from the person who takes them away.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Treat others in the same way that you would want them to treat you.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.</verse>
				<verse number="34">And if you lend to those from whom you hope to be repaid, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may be repaid in full.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to ungrateful and evil people.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</verse>
				<verse number="37">“Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Give, and it will be given to you: A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be poured into your lap. For the measure you use will be the measure you receive.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">He also told them a parable: “Someone who is blind cannot lead another who is blind, can he? Won’t they both fall into a pit?</verse>
				<verse number="40">A disciple is not greater than his teacher, but everyone when fully trained will be like his teacher.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?</verse>
				<verse number="42">How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while you yourself don’t see the beam in your own? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</verse>
				<verse number="43">“For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit,</verse>
				<verse number="44">for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from brambles.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The good person out of the good treasury of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasury produces evil, for his mouth speaks from what fills his heart.</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do what I tell you?</verse>
				<verse number="47">“Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them into practice — I will show you what he is like:</verse>
				<verse number="48">He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep, and laid the foundation on bedrock. When a flood came, the river burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built.</verse>
				<verse number="49">But the person who hears and does not put my words into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against that house, it collapsed immediately, and was utterly destroyed!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus had finished teaching all this to the people, he entered Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="2">A centurion there had a slave who was highly regarded, but who was sick and at the point of death.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his slave.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When they came to Jesus, they urged him earnestly, “He is worthy to have you do this for him,</verse>
				<verse number="5">because he loves our nation, and even built our synagogue.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.</verse>
				<verse number="7">That is why I did not presume to come to you. Instead, say the word, and my servant must be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. He turned and said to the crowd that followed him, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave well.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As he approached the town gate, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow ), and a large crowd from the town was with her.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he came up and touched the bier, and those who carried it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has come to help his people!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">This report about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.</verse>
				<verse number="18">John’s disciples informed him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples</verse>
				<verse number="19">and sent them to Jesus to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’”</verse>
				<verse number="21">At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and granted sight to many who were blind.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So he answered them, “Go tell John what you have seen and heard: The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good news proclaimed to them.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">When John’s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
				<verse number="25">What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? Look, those who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are in kings’ courts!</verse>
				<verse number="26">What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="27">This is the one about whom it is written, ‘ Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">(Now all the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.</verse>
				<verse number="30">However, the Pharisees and the experts in religious law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John. )</verse>
				<verse number="31">“To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
				<verse number="32">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, ‘We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance; we wailed in mourning, yet you did not weep.’</verse>
				<verse number="33">For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’</verse>
				<verse number="34">The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</verse>
				<verse number="35">But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then when a woman of that town, who was a sinner, learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.</verse>
				<verse number="38">As she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the perfumed oil.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">So Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He replied, “Say it, Teacher.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">“A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty.</verse>
				<verse number="42">When they could not pay, he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” Jesus said to him, “You have judged rightly.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then, turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
				<verse number="45">You gave me no kiss of greeting, but from the time I entered she has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="46">You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Therefore I tell you, her sins, which were many, are forgiven, thus she loved much; but the one who is forgiven little loves little.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Some time afterward he went on through towns and villages, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and disabilities: Mary (called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and Joanna the wife of Cuza (Herod’s household manager), Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their own resources.</verse>
				<verse number="4">While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another, he spoke to them in a parable:</verse>
				<verse number="5">“A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled on, and the wild birds devoured it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Other seed fell on rock, and when it came up, it withered because it had no moisture.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up with it and choked it.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But other seed fell on good soil and grew, and it produced a hundred times as much grain.” As he said this, he called out, “The one who has ears to hear had better listen!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He said, “You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that although they see they may not see, and although they hear they may not understand.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Now the parable means this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Those along the path are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in a time of testing fall away.</verse>
				<verse number="14">As for the seed that fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But as for the seed that landed on good soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word, cling to it with an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with steadfast endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in can see the light.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So listen carefully, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But he replied to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set out,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and as they sailed he fell asleep. Now a violent windstorm came down on the lake, and the boat started filling up with water, and they were in danger.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They came and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are about to die!” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they died down, and it was calm.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">So they sailed over to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="27">As Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man from the town met him who was possessed by demons. For a long time this man had worn no clothes and had not lived in a house, but among the tombs.</verse>
				<verse number="28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and shouted with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I beg you, do not torment me!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">For Jesus had started commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, so he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard. But he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.)</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus then asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">And they began to beg him not to order them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them. He gave them permission.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of pigs rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So the people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus. They found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and left.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="39">“Return to your home, and declare what God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue, came up. Falling at Jesus’ feet, he pleaded with him to come to his house,</verse>
				<verse number="42">because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed around him.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years but could not be healed by anyone.</verse>
				<verse number="44">She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak, and at once the bleeding stopped.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then Jesus asked, “Who was it who touched me?” When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!”</verse>
				<verse number="46">But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">When the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">While he was still speaking, someone from the synagogue ruler’s house came and said, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">But when Jesus heard this, he told him, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">Now when he came to the house, Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Now they were all wailing and mourning for her, but he said, “Stop your weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">And they began making fun of him, because they knew that she was dead.</verse>
				<verse number="54">But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said, “Child, get up.”</verse>
				<verse number="55">Her spirit returned, and she got up immediately. Then he told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">After Jesus called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey — no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and do not take an extra tunic.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Wherever they do not receive you, as you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening, and he was thoroughly perplexed, because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
				<verse number="8">while others were saying that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Herod said, “I had John beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” So Herod wanted to learn about Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But when the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now the day began to draw to a close, so the twelve came and said to Jesus, “Send the crowd away, so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and food, because we are in an isolated place.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They replied, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish — unless we go and buy food for all these people.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">(Now about five thousand men were there.) Then he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they did as Jesus directed, and the people all sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them. He gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="17">They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up — twelve baskets of broken pieces.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">They answered, “John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has risen.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But he forcefully commanded them not to tell this to anyone,</verse>
				<verse number="22">saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
				<verse number="26">For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But I tell you most certainly, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Now about eight days after these sayings, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up the mountain to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="29">As he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became very bright, a brilliant white.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure that he was about to carry out at Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now Peter and those with him were quite sleepy, but as they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then as the men were starting to leave, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” — not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
				<verse number="34">As he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. So they kept silent and told no one at that time anything of what they had seen.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Now on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son — he is my only child!</verse>
				<verse number="39">A spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions and causes him to foam at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves him alone, torturing him severely.</verse>
				<verse number="40">I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">As the boy was approaching, the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then they were all astonished at the mighty power of God. But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="44">“Take these words to heart, for the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">But they did not understand this statement; its meaning had been concealed from them, so that they could not grasp it. Yet they were afraid to ask him about this statement.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Now an argument started among the disciples as to which of them might be the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="47">But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts, he took a child, had him stand by his side,</verse>
				<verse number="48">and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me, for the one who is least among you all is the one who is great.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he is not a disciple along with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">Now when the days drew near for him to be taken up, Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="52">He sent messengers on ahead of him. As they went along, they entered a Samaritan village to make things ready in advance for him,</verse>
				<verse number="53">but the villagers refused to welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Now when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”</verse>
				<verse number="55">But Jesus turned and rebuked them,</verse>
				<verse number="56">and they went on to another village.</verse>
				<verse number="57">As they were walking along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Jesus said to another, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</verse>
				<verse number="60">But Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="61">Yet another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.”</verse>
				<verse number="62">Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Go! I am sending you out like lambs surrounded by wolves.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Do not carry a money bag, a traveler’s bag, or sandals, and greet no one on the road.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Whenever you enter a house, first say, ‘May peace be on this house!’</verse>
				<verse number="6">And if a peace-loving person is there, your peace will remain on him, but if not, it will return to you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you, for the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from house to house.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Whenever you enter a town and the people welcome you, eat what is set before you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Heal the sick in that town and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come upon you!’</verse>
				<verse number="10">But whenever you enter a town and the people do not welcome you, go into its streets and say,</verse>
				<verse number="11">‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this: The kingdom of God has come.’</verse>
				<verse number="12">I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town!</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you!</verse>
				<verse number="15">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So he said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Look, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and on the full force of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names stand written in heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.</verse>
				<verse number="22">All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!</verse>
				<verse number="24">For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you understand it?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">The expert answered, “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Jesus said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">But the expert, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him up, and went off, leaving him half dead.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Now by chance a priest was going down that road, but when he saw the injured man he passed by on the other side.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So too a Levite, when he came up to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But a Samaritan who was traveling came to where the injured man was, and when he saw him, he felt compassion for him.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever else you spend, I will repay you when I come back this way.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">Which of these three do you think became a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">The expert in religious law said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” So Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as a guest.</verse>
				<verse number="39">She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he said.</verse>
				<verse number="40">But Martha was distracted with all the preparations she had to make, so she came up to him and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work alone? Tell her to help me.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things,</verse>
				<verse number="42">but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the best part; it will not be taken away from her.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So he said to them, “When you pray, say: Father, may your name be honored; may your kingdom come.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Give us each day our daily bread,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And do not lead us into temptation.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</verse>
				<verse number="6">because a friend of mine has stopped here while on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he will reply from inside, ‘Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">I tell you, even though the man inside will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of the first man’s sheer persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</verse>
				<verse number="11">What father among you, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</verse>
				<verse number="13">If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the man who had been mute began to speak, and the crowds were amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But some of them said, “By the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he casts out demons.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Others, to test him, began asking for a sign from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But Jesus, realizing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and a divided household falls.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So if Satan too is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? I ask you this because you claim that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But when a stronger man attacks and conquers him, he takes away the first man’s armor on which the man relied and divides up his plunder.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through waterless places looking for rest but not finding any. Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">When it returns, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">As he said these things, a woman in the crowd spoke out to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">But he replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">As the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say, “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon — and now, something greater than Solomon is here!</verse>
				<verse number="32">The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them — and now, something greater than Jonah is here!</verse>
				<verse number="33">“No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is diseased, your body is full of darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Therefore see to it that the light in you is not darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="36">If then your whole body is full of light, with no part in the dark, it will be as full of light as when the light of a lamp shines on you.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">As he spoke, a Pharisee invited Jesus to have a meal with him, so he went in and took his place at the table.</verse>
				<verse number="38">The Pharisee was astonished when he saw that Jesus did not first wash his hands before the meal.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You fools! Didn’t the one who made the outside make the inside as well?</verse>
				<verse number="41">But give from your heart to those in need, and then everything will be clean for you.</verse>
				<verse number="42">“But woe to you Pharisees! You give a tenth of your mint, rue, and every herb, yet you neglect justice and love for God! But you should have done these things without neglecting the others.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Woe to you Pharisees! You love the best seats in the synagogues and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces!</verse>
				<verse number="44">Woe to you! You are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without realizing it!”</verse>
				<verse number="45">One of the experts in religious law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things you insult us too.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">But Jesus replied, “Woe to you experts in religious law as well! You load people down with burdens difficult to bear, yet you yourselves refuse to touch the burdens with even one of your fingers!</verse>
				<verse number="47">Woe to you! You build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.</verse>
				<verse number="48">So you testify that you approve of the deeds of your ancestors, because they killed the prophets and you build their tombs!</verse>
				<verse number="49">For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’</verse>
				<verse number="50">so that this generation may be held accountable for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</verse>
				<verse number="51">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Woe to you experts in religious law! You have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not go in yourselves, and you hindered those who were going in.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">When he went out from there, the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to oppose him bitterly, and to ask him hostile questions about many things,</verse>
				<verse number="54">plotting against him, to catch him in something he might say.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Meanwhile, when many thousands of the crowd had gathered so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So then whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.</verse>
				<verse number="4">“I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more they can do.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But I will warn you whom you should fear: Fear the one who, after the killing, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Aren’t five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In fact, even the hairs on your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before God’s angels.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But the one who denies me before men will be denied before God’s angels.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But when they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how you should make your defense or what you should say,</verse>
				<verse number="12">for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you must say.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Jesus said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator between you two?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then he said to them, “Watch out and guard yourself from all types of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">He then told them a parable: “The land of a certain rich man produced an abundant crop,</verse>
				<verse number="17">so he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And I will say to myself, “You have plenty of goods stored up for many years; relax, eat, drink, celebrate!”’</verse>
				<verse number="20">But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you, but who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’</verse>
				<verse number="21">So it is with the one who stores up riches for himself, but is not rich toward God.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For there is more to life than food, and more to the body than clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!</verse>
				<verse number="25">And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life?</verse>
				<verse number="26">So if you cannot do such a very little thing as this, why do you worry about the rest?</verse>
				<verse number="27">Consider how the flowers grow; they do not work or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these!</verse>
				<verse number="28">And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you people of little faith!</verse>
				<verse number="29">So do not be overly concerned about what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not worry about such things.</verse>
				<verse number="30">For all the nations of the world pursue these things, and your Father knows that you need them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Instead, pursue his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
				<verse number="32">“Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves purses that do not wear out — a treasure in heaven that never decreases, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
				<verse number="35">“Get dressed for service and keep your lamps burning;</verse>
				<verse number="36">be like people waiting for their master to come back from the wedding celebration, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Blessed are those slaves whom their master finds alert when he returns! I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, have them take their place at the table, and will come and wait on them!</verse>
				<verse number="38">Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, blessed are those slaves!</verse>
				<verse number="39">But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for everyone?”</verse>
				<verse number="42">The Lord replied, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his household servants, to give them their allowance of food at the proper time?</verse>
				<verse number="43">Blessed is that slave whom his master finds at work when he returns.</verse>
				<verse number="44">I tell you the truth, the master will put him in charge of all his possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="45">But if that slave should say to himself, ‘My master is delayed in returning,’ and he begins to beat the other slaves, both men and women, and to eat, drink, and get drunk,</verse>
				<verse number="46">then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee, and will cut him in two, and assign him a place with the unfaithful.</verse>
				<verse number="47">That servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or do what his master asked will receive a severe beating.</verse>
				<verse number="48">But the one who did not know his master’s will and did things worthy of punishment will receive a light beating. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and from the one who has been entrusted with much, even more will be asked.</verse>
				<verse number="49">“I have come to bring fire on the earth — and how I wish it were already kindled!</verse>
				<verse number="50">I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is finished!</verse>
				<verse number="51">Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!</verse>
				<verse number="52">For from now on there will be five in one household divided, three against two and two against three.</verse>
				<verse number="53">They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and it does.</verse>
				<verse number="55">And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and there is.</verse>
				<verse number="56">You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how can you not know how to interpret the present time?</verse>
				<verse number="57">“And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?</verse>
				<verse number="58">As you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, so that he will not drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</verse>
				<verse number="59">I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid the very last cent!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Now there were some present on that occasion who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He answered them, “Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?</verse>
				<verse number="3">No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you will all perish as well!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them, do you think they were worse offenders than all the others who live in Jerusalem?</verse>
				<verse number="5">No, I tell you! But unless you repent you will all perish as well!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So he said to the worker who tended the vineyard, ‘For three years now, I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and each time I inspect it I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue to deplete the soil?’</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the worker answered him, ‘Sir, leave it alone this year too, until I dig around it and put fertilizer on it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then if it bears fruit next year, very well, but if not, you can cut it down.’”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself up completely.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which work should be done! So come and be healed on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from its stall, and lead it to water?</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then shouldn’t this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be released from this imprisonment on the Sabbath day?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When he said this all his adversaries were humiliated, but the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Thus Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what should I compare it?</verse>
				<verse number="19">It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the wild birds nested in its branches.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Again he said, “To what should I compare the kingdom of God?</verse>
				<verse number="21">It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Jesus traveled throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few be saved?” So he said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Exert every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, then you will stand outside and start to knock on the door and beg him, ‘Lord, let us in!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don’t know where you come from.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">But he will reply, ‘I don’t know where you come from! Go away from me, all you evildoers!’</verse>
				<verse number="28">There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown out.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and take their places at the banquet table in the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But indeed, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">At that time, some Pharisees came up and said to Jesus, “Get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But he said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Look, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete my work.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, because it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would have none of it!</verse>
				<verse number="35">Look, your house is forsaken! And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! ’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees, they were watching him closely.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There right in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But they remained silent. So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he said to them, “Which of you, if you have a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But they could not reply to this.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then when Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. He said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="8">“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, because a person more distinguished than you may have been invited by your host.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then, ashamed, you will begin to move to the least important place.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But when you are invited, go and take the least important place, so that when your host approaches he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up here to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">He said also to the man who had invited him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors so you can be invited by them in return and get repaid.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But when you host an elaborate meal, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will feast in the kingdom of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Jesus said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet and invited many guests.</verse>
				<verse number="17">At the time for the banquet he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, because everything is now ready.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going out to examine them. Please excuse me.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">Another said, ‘I just got married, and I cannot come.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">So the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the master of the household was furious and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then the slave said, ‘Sir, what you instructed has been done, and there is still room.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the master said to his slave, ‘Go out to the highways and country roads and urge people to come in, so that my house will be filled.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For I tell you, not one of those individuals who were invited will taste my banquet!’”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now large crowds were accompanying Jesus, and turning to them he said,</verse>
				<verse number="26">“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn’t sit down first and compute the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?</verse>
				<verse number="29">Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish the tower, all who see it will begin to make fun of him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They will say, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish!’</verse>
				<verse number="31">Or what king, going out to confront another king in battle, will not sit down first and determine whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</verse>
				<verse number="32">If he cannot succeed, he will send a representative while the other is still a long way off and ask for terms of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="33">In the same way therefore not one of you can be my disciple if he does not renounce all his own possessions.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“Salt is good, but if salt loses its flavor, how can its flavor be restored?</verse>
				<verse number="35">It is of no value for the soil or for the manure pile; it is to be thrown out. The one who has ears to hear had better listen!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Jesus told them this parable:</verse>
				<verse number="4">“Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.</verse>
				<verse number="8">“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’</verse>
				<verse number="10">In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will belong to me.’ So he divided his assets between them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger!</verse>
				<verse number="18">I will get up and go to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers.”’</verse>
				<verse number="20">So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way from home his father saw him, and his heart went out to him; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the father said to his slaves, ‘Hurry! Bring the best robe, and put it on him! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!</verse>
				<verse number="23">Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let us eat and celebrate,</verse>
				<verse number="24">because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again — he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“Now his older son was in the field. As he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The slave replied, ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound.’</verse>
				<verse number="28">But the older son became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and appealed to him,</verse>
				<verse number="29">but he answered his father, ‘Look! These many years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never disobeyed your commands. Yet you never gave me even a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!</verse>
				<verse number="30">But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that belongs to me is yours.</verse>
				<verse number="32">It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found.’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Jesus also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who was informed of accusations that his manager was wasting his assets.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So he called the manager in and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in the account of your administration, because you can no longer be my manager.’</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, since my master is taking my position away from me? I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m too ashamed to beg.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I know what to do so that when I am put out of management, people will welcome me into their homes.’</verse>
				<verse number="5">So he contacted his master’s debtors one by one. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</verse>
				<verse number="6">The man replied, ‘A hundred measures of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ The second man replied, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their contemporaries than the people of light.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by how you use worldly wealth, so that when it runs out you will be welcomed into the eternal homes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If then you haven’t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will entrust you with the true riches?</verse>
				<verse number="12">And if you haven’t been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you your own?</verse>
				<verse number="13">No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But Jesus said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in men’s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God’s sight.</verse>
				<verse number="16">“The law and the prophets were in force until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urged to enter it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores,</verse>
				<verse number="21">who longed to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. In addition, the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Now the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And in hell, as he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far off with Lazarus at his side.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this fire.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and Lazarus likewise bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us, so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">So the rich man said, ‘Then I beg you, father — send Lazarus to my father’s house</verse>
				<verse number="28">(for I have five brothers) to warn them so that they don’t come into this place of torment.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they must respond to them.’</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then the rich man said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">He replied to him, ‘If they do not respond to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Jesus said to his disciples, “Stumbling blocks are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!</verse>
				<verse number="2">It would be better for him to have a millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the Lord replied, “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this black mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled out by the roots and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“Would any one of you say to your slave who comes in from the field after plowing or shepherding sheep, ‘Come at once and sit down for a meal’?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Won’t the master instead say to him, ‘Get my dinner ready, and make yourself ready to serve me while I eat and drink. Then you may eat and drink’?</verse>
				<verse number="9">He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told, will he?</verse>
				<verse number="10">So you too, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, ‘We are slaves undeserving of special praise; we have only done what was our duty.’”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him. They stood at a distance,</verse>
				<verse number="13">raised their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When he saw them he said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went along, they were cleansed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then one of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He fell with his face to the ground at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (Now he was a Samaritan.)</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Jesus said, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he said to the man, “Get up and go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now at one point the Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God was coming, so he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed,</verse>
				<verse number="21">nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then people will say to you, ‘Look, there he is!’ or ‘Look, here he is!’ Do not go out or chase after them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For just like the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="27">People were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage — right up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot, people were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;</verse>
				<verse number="29">but on the day Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</verse>
				<verse number="30">It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="31">On that day, anyone who is on the roof, with his goods in the house, must not come down to take them away, and likewise the person in the field must not turn back.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife!</verse>
				<verse number="33">Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.</verse>
				<verse number="35">There will be two women grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">***</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then the disciples said to him, “Where, Lord?” He replied to them, “Where the dead body is, there the vultures will gather.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.</verse>
				<verse number="3">There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</verse>
				<verse number="4">For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people,</verse>
				<verse number="5">yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?</verse>
				<verse number="8">I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: extortionists, unrighteous people, adulterers — or even like this tax collector.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get.’</verse>
				<verse number="13">The tax collector, however, stood far off and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, be merciful to me, sinner that I am!’</verse>
				<verse number="14">I tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now people were even bringing their babies to him for him to touch. But when the disciples saw it, they began to scold those who brought them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Jesus called for the children, saying, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now a certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You know the commandments: ‘ Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
				<verse number="21">The man replied, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When Jesus noticed this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
				<verse number="25">In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Those who heard this said, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">He replied, “What is impossible for mere humans is possible for God.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">And Peter said, “Look, we have left everything we own to follow you!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of God’s kingdom</verse>
				<verse number="30">who will not receive many times more in this age — and in the age to come, eternal life.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</verse>
				<verse number="32">For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; he will be mocked, mistreated, and spat on.</verse>
				<verse number="33">They will flog him severely and kill him. Yet on the third day he will rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">But the twelve understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what Jesus meant.</verse>
				<verse number="35">As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging.</verse>
				<verse number="36">When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was going on.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him,</verse>
				<verse number="41">“What do you want me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, let me see again.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they too gave praise to God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because I must stay at your house today.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And when the people saw it, they all complained, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore he said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And he summoned ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business with these until I come back.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the first one came before him and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the king said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you will have authority over ten cities.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then the second one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">So the king said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then another slave came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina that I put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">The king said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! So you knew, did you, that I was a severe man, withdrawing what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow?</verse>
				<verse number="23">Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could have collected it with interest?’</verse>
				<verse number="24">And he said to his attendants, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas already!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me!’”</verse>
				<verse number="28">After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="30">telling them, “Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
				<verse number="31">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</verse>
				<verse number="32">So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them.</verse>
				<verse number="33">As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying that colt?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">They replied, “The Lord needs it.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it.</verse>
				<verse number="36">As he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.</verse>
				<verse number="37">As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen:</verse>
				<verse number="38">“ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">He answered, “I tell you, if they keep silent, the very stones will cry out!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it,</verse>
				<verse number="42">saying, “If you had only known on this day, even you, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="43">For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and surround you and close in on you from every side.</verse>
				<verse number="44">They will demolish you — you and your children within your walls — and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there,</verse>
				<verse number="46">saying to them, “It is written, ‘ My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him,</verse>
				<verse number="48">but they could not find a way to do it, for all the people hung on his words.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Now one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the experts in the law with the elders came up</verse>
				<verse number="2">and said to him, “Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is who gave you this authority?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">He answered them, “I will also ask you a question, and you tell me:</verse>
				<verse number="4">John’s baptism — was it from heaven or from people?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if we say, ‘From people,’ all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they replied that they did not know where it came from.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by whose authority I do these things.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When harvest time came, he sent a slave to the tenants so that they would give him his portion of the crop. However, the tenants beat his slave and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So he sent another slave. They beat this one too, treated him outrageously, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So he sent still a third. They even wounded this one, and threw him out.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my one dear son; perhaps they will respect him.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">But when the tenants saw him, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
				<verse number="15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
				<verse number="16">He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “May this never happen!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But Jesus looked straight at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then the experts in the law and the chief priests wanted to arrest him that very hour, because they realized he had told this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then they watched him carefully and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They wanted to take advantage of what he might say so that they could deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Thus they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Is it right for us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar or not?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But Jesus perceived their deceit and said to them,</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” They said, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he said to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Thus they were unable in the presence of the people to trap him with his own words. And stunned by his answer, they fell silent.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now some Sadducees (who contend that there is no resurrection) came to him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies leaving a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died without children.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The second</verse>
				<verse number="31">and then the third married her, and in this same way all seven died, leaving no children.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Finally the woman died too.</verse>
				<verse number="33">In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had married her.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">So Jesus said to them, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="35">But those who are regarded as worthy to share in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="36">In fact, they can no longer die, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But even Moses revealed that the dead are raised in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live before him.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then some of the experts in the law answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">For they did not dare any longer to ask him anything.</verse>
				<verse number="41">But he said to them, “How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
				<verse number="42">For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘ The Lord said to my lord, “ Sit at my right hand,</verse>
				<verse number="43">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’</verse>
				<verse number="44">If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</verse>
				<verse number="45">As all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</verse>
				<verse number="46">“Beware of the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes, and they love elaborate greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
				<verse number="47">They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. They will receive a more severe punishment.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He said, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put in more than all of them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For they all offered their gifts out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in everything she had to live on.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now while some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said,</verse>
				<verse number="6">“As for these things that you are gazing at, the days will come when not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So they asked him, “Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that these things are about to take place?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">He said, “Watch out that you are not misled. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them!</verse>
				<verse number="9">And when you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be afraid. For these things must happen first, but the end will not come at once.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then he said to them, “Nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="11">There will be great earthquakes, and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be terrifying sights and great signs from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.</verse>
				<verse number="13">This will be a time for you to serve as witnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore be resolved not to rehearse ahead of time how to make your defense.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I will give you the words along with the wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will have some of you put to death.</verse>
				<verse number="17">You will be hated by everyone because of my name.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Yet not a hair of your head will perish.</verse>
				<verse number="19">By your endurance you will gain your lives.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who are inside the city must depart. Those who are out in the country must not enter it,</verse>
				<verse number="22">because these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people.</verse>
				<verse number="24">They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away as captives among all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth nations will be in distress, anxious over the roaring of the sea and the surging waves.</verse>
				<verse number="26">People will be fainting from fear and from the expectation of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But when these things begin to happen, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the other trees.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When they sprout leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.</verse>
				<verse number="31">So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
				<verse number="32">I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“But be on your guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day close down upon you suddenly like a trap.</verse>
				<verse number="35">For it will overtake all who live on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
				<verse number="36">But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that must happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">So every day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, but at night he went and stayed on the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="38">And all the people came to him early in the morning to listen to him in the temple courts.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find some way to execute Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he might betray Jesus, handing him over to them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They were delighted and arranged to give him money.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">He said to them, “Listen, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. Make preparations there.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So they went and found things just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">And in the same way he took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.</verse>
				<verse number="21">“But look, the hand of the one who betrays me is with me on the table.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the Son of Man is to go just as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So they began to question one another as to which of them it could possibly be who would do this.</verse>
				<verse number="24">A dispute also started among them over which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">Not so with you; instead the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the one who serves.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For who is greater, the one who is seated at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is seated at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“You are the ones who have remained with me in my trials.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Thus I grant to you a kingdom, just as my Father granted to me,</verse>
				<verse number="30">that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“Simon, Simon, pay attention! Satan has demanded to have you all, to sift you like wheat,</verse>
				<verse number="32">but I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">But Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you out with no money bag, or traveler’s bag, or sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you?” They replied, “Nothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">He said to them, “But now, the one who has a money bag must take it, and likewise a traveler’s bag too. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘ And he was counted with the transgressors.’ For what is written about me is being fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” Then he told them, “It is enough.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then Jesus went out and made his way, as he customarily did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.</verse>
				<verse number="40">When he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">He went away from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,</verse>
				<verse number="42">“Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.” [</verse>
				<verse number="43">Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</verse>
				<verse number="44">And in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.]</verse>
				<verse number="45">When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, exhausted from grief.</verse>
				<verse number="46">So he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not fall into temptation!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd appeared, and the man named Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He walked up to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
				<verse number="48">But Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
				<verse number="49">When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we use our swords?”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Then one of them struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear.</verse>
				<verse number="51">But Jesus said, “Enough of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.</verse>
				<verse number="52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come out to get him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs like you would against an outlaw?</verse>
				<verse number="53">Day after day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not arrest me. But this is your hour, and that of the power of darkness!”</verse>
				<verse number="54">Then they arrested Jesus, led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.</verse>
				<verse number="55">When they had made a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Then a slave girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, stared at him and said, “This man was with him too!”</verse>
				<verse number="57">But Peter denied it: “Woman, I don’t know him!”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Then a little later someone else saw him and said, “You are one of them too.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”</verse>
				<verse number="59">And after about an hour still another insisted, “Certainly this man was with him, because he too is a Galilean.”</verse>
				<verse number="60">But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” At that moment, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="61">Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
				<verse number="62">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
				<verse number="63">Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him.</verse>
				<verse number="64">They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly, “Prophesy! Who hit you?”</verse>
				<verse number="65">They also said many other things against him, reviling him.</verse>
				<verse number="66">When day came, the council of the elders of the people gathered together, both the chief priests and the experts in the law. Then they led Jesus away to their council</verse>
				<verse number="67">and said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe,</verse>
				<verse number="68">and if I ask you, you will not answer.</verse>
				<verse number="69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="70">So they all said, “Are you the Son of God, then?” He answered them, “You say that I am.”</verse>
				<verse number="71">Then they said, “Why do we need further testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar and claiming that he himself is Christ, a king.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied, “You say so.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But they persisted in saying, “He incites the people by teaching throughout all Judea. It started in Galilee and ended up here!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he learned that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who also happened to be in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some miraculous sign.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So Herod questioned him at considerable length; Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The chief priests and the experts in the law were there, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, dressing him in elegant clothes, Herod sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
				<verse number="12">That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other, for prior to this they had been enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. When I examined him before you, I did not find this man guilty of anything you accused him of doing.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing deserving death.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I will therefore have him flogged and release him.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">***</verse>
				<verse number="18">But they all shouted out together, “Take this man away! Release Barabbas for us!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">(This was a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.)</verse>
				<verse number="20">Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted to release Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But they kept on shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">A third time he said to them, “Why? What wrong has he done? I have found him guilty of no crime deserving death. I will therefore flog him and release him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that he be crucified. And their shouts prevailed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He released the man they asked for, who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.</verse>
				<verse number="26">As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country. They placed the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="27">A great number of the people followed him, among them women who were mourning and wailing for him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For this is certain: The days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore children, and the breasts that never nursed!’</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘ Fall on us! ’ and to the hills, ‘ Cover us! ’</verse>
				<verse number="31">For if such things are done when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
				<verse number="34">[But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” ] Then they threw dice to divide his clothes.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The people also stood there watching, but the rulers ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,</verse>
				<verse number="37">and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">There was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">One of the criminals who was hanging there railed at him, saying, “Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!”</verse>
				<verse number="40">But the other rebuked him, saying, “Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</verse>
				<verse number="41">And we rightly so, for we are getting what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">And Jesus said to him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,</verse>
				<verse number="45">because the sun’s light failed. The temple curtain was torn in two.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit! ” And after he said this he breathed his last.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God and said, “Certainly this man was innocent!”</verse>
				<verse number="48">And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.</verse>
				<verse number="49">And all those who knew Jesus stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee saw these things.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man.</verse>
				<verse number="51">(He had not consented to their plan and action.) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was looking forward to the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="52">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="53">Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had yet been buried.</verse>
				<verse number="54">It was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="55">The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Then they returned and prepared aromatic spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb, taking the aromatic spices they had prepared.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
				<verse number="3">but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="4">While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in dazzling attire.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The women were terribly frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="6">He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
				<verse number="7">that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the women remembered his words,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But these words seemed like pure nonsense to them, and they did not believe them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth; then he went home, wondering what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now that very day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="15">While they were talking and debating these things, Jesus himself approached and began to accompany them</verse>
				<verse number="16">(but their eyes were kept from recognizing him).</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then he said to them, “What are these matters you are discussing so intently as you walk along?” And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">He said to them, “What things?” “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene,” they replied, “a man who, with his powerful deeds and words, proved to be a prophet before God and all the people;</verse>
				<verse number="20">and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Not only this, but it is now the third day since these things happened.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Furthermore, some women of our group amazed us. They were at the tomb early this morning,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and when they did not find his body, they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he said to them, “You foolish people — how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
				<verse number="26">Wasn’t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So they approached the village where they were going. He acted as though he wanted to go farther,</verse>
				<verse number="29">but they urged him, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening and the day is almost done.” So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">At this point their eyes were opened and they recognized him. Then he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and those with them gathered together</verse>
				<verse number="34">and saying, “The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then they told what had happened on the road, and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.</verse>
				<verse number="36">While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But they were startled and terrified, thinking they saw a ghost.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then he said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
				<verse number="39">Look at my hands and my feet; it’s me! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="41">And while they still could not believe it (because of their joy) and were amazed, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”</verse>
				<verse number="42">So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
				<verse number="43">and he took it and ate it in front of them.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="46">and said to them, “Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
				<verse number="47">and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
				<verse number="49">And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Now during the blessing he departed and was taken up into heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="52">So they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
				<verse number="53">and were continually in the temple courts blessing God.</verse>

		<book number="43">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The Word was with God in the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="3">All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He came to what was his own, but his own people did not receive him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But to all who have received him — those who believe in his name — he has given the right to become God’s children</verse>
				<verse number="13">— children not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband’s decision, but by God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory — the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="15">John testified about him and shouted out, “This one was the one about whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’”</verse>
				<verse number="16">For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="18">No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He confessed — he did not deny but confessed — “I am not the Christ!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then they said to him, “Who are you? Tell us so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">John said, “I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. )</verse>
				<verse number="25">So they asked John, “Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not recognize,</verse>
				<verse number="27">who is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!”</verse>
				<verse number="28">These things happened in Bethany across the Jordan River where John was baptizing.</verse>
				<verse number="29">On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
				<verse number="30">This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’</verse>
				<verse number="31">I did not recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he could be revealed to Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">And I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining — this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">When John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do you want?” So they said to him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus answered, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated Christ).</verse>
				<verse number="42">Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).</verse>
				<verse number="43">On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)</verse>
				<verse number="45">Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about — Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”</verse>
				<verse number="46">Nathanael replied, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see.”</verse>
				<verse number="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed, “Look, a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit! ”</verse>
				<verse number="48">Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?” Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus said to him, “Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">He continued, “I tell all of you the solemn truth — you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Jesus replied, “Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has not yet come.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">His mother told the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus told the servants, “Fill the water jars with water.” So they filled them up to the very top.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward,” and they did.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom</verse>
				<verse number="10">and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk. You have kept the good wine until now!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs, in Cana of Galilee. In this way he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting at tables.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, with the sheep and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
				<verse number="16">To those who sold the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, “ Zeal for your house will devour me.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So then the Jewish leaders responded, “What sign can you show us, since you are doing these things?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus replied, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then the Jewish leaders said to him, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and are you going to raise it up in three days?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So after he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many people believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He did not need anyone to testify about man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Now a certain man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council,</verse>
				<verse number="2">came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">The wind blows wherever it will, and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Nicodemus replied, “How can these things be?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus answered, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand these things?</verse>
				<verse number="11">I tell you the solemn truth, we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen, but you people do not accept our testimony.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If I have told you people about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?</verse>
				<verse number="13">No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven — the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now this is the basis for judging: that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After this, Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.</verse>
				<verse number="23">John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming to him and being baptized.</verse>
				<verse number="24">(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, about whom you testified — see, he is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to him!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete.</verse>
				<verse number="30">He must become more important while I become less important.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The one who comes from above is superior to all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
				<verse number="33">The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit sparingly.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The Father loves the Son and has placed all things under his authority.</verse>
				<verse number="36">The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The one who rejects the Son will not see life, but God’s wrath remains on him.</verse>

			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
				<verse number="2">(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),</verse>
				<verse number="3">he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But he had to pass through Samaria.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now he came to a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, since he was tired from the journey, sat right down beside the well. It was about noon.</verse>
				<verse number="7">A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me some water to drink.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">(For his disciples had gone off into the town to buy supplies. )</verse>
				<verse number="9">So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you — a Jew — ask me, a Samaritan woman, for water to drink?” (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus answered her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who said to you, ‘Give me some water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">“Sir,” the woman said to him, “you have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do you get this living water?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Surely you’re not greater than our ancestor Jacob, are you? For he gave us this well and drank from it himself, along with his sons and his livestock.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus replied, “Everyone who drinks some of this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">He said to her, “Go call your husband and come back here.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">The woman replied, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “Right you are when you said, ‘I have no husband,’</verse>
				<verse number="18">for you have had five husbands, and the man you are living with now is not your husband. This you said truthfully!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You people worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But a time is coming — and now is here — when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.</verse>
				<verse number="24">God is spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever he comes, he will tell us everything.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now at that very moment his disciples came back. They were shocked because he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then the woman left her water jar, went off into the town and said to the people,</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Surely he can’t be the Messiah, can he?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So they left the town and began coming to him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Don’t you say, ‘There are four more months and then comes the harvest?’ I tell you, look up and see that the fields are already white for harvest!</verse>
				<verse number="36">The one who reaps receives pay and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For in this instance the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the report of the woman who testified, “He told me everything I ever did.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. He stayed there two days,</verse>
				<verse number="41">and because of his word many more believed.</verse>
				<verse number="42">They said to the woman, “No longer do we believe because of your words, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this one really is the Savior of the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">After the two days he departed from there to Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="44">(For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</verse>
				<verse number="45">So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had gone to the feast).</verse>
				<verse number="46">Now he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick.</verse>
				<verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.</verse>
				<verse number="48">So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe!”</verse>
				<verse number="49">“Sir,” the official said to him, “come down before my child dies.”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Jesus told him, “Go home; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and set off for home.</verse>
				<verse number="51">While he was on his way down, his slaves met him and told him that his son was going to live.</verse>
				<verse number="52">So he asked them the time when his condition began to improve, and they told him, “Yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon the fever left him.”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Then the father realized that it was the very time Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed along with his entire household.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign when he returned from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">After this there was a Jewish feast, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool called Bethzatha in Aramaic, which has five covered walkways.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A great number of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people were lying in these walkways.</verse>
				<verse number="4">***</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now a man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When Jesus saw him lying there and when he realized that the man had been disabled a long time already, he said to him, “Do you want to become well?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I am trying to get into the water, someone else goes down there before me.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus said to him, “Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Immediately the man was healed, and he picked up his mat and started walking. (Now that day was a Sabbath.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and you are not permitted to carry your mat.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">But he answered them, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.</verse>
				<verse number="14">After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well. Don’t sin any more, lest anything worse happen to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the one who had made him well.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began persecuting him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So he told them, “My Father is working until now, and I too am working.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">For this reason the Jewish leaders were trying even harder to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, the Son can do nothing on his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does, and will show him greater deeds than these, so that you will be amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Furthermore, the Father does not judge anyone, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,</verse>
				<verse number="23">so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has crossed over from death to life.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I tell you the solemn truth, a time is coming — and is now here — when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For just as the Father has life in himself, thus he has granted the Son to have life in himself,</verse>
				<verse number="27">and he has granted the Son authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>
				<verse number="29">and will come out — the ones who have done what is good to the resurrection resulting in life, and the ones who have done what is evil to the resurrection resulting in condemnation.</verse>
				<verse number="30">I can do nothing on my own initiative. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="31">“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
				<verse number="32">There is another who testifies about me, and I know the testimony he testifies about me is true.</verse>
				<verse number="33">You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="34">(I do not accept human testimony, but I say this so that you may be saved.)</verse>
				<verse number="35">He was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice greatly for a short time in his light.</verse>
				<verse number="36">“But I have a testimony greater than that from John. For the deeds that the Father has assigned me to complete — the deeds I am now doing — testify about me that the Father has sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="37">And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time,</verse>
				<verse number="38">nor do you have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the one whom he sent.</verse>
				<verse number="39">You study the scriptures thoroughly because you think in them you possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about me,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.</verse>
				<verse number="41">“I do not accept praise from people,</verse>
				<verse number="42">but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you.</verse>
				<verse number="43">I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</verse>
				<verse number="44">How can you believe, if you accept praise from one another and don’t seek the praise that comes from the only God?</verse>
				<verse number="45">“Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.</verse>
				<verse number="46">If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.</verse>
				<verse number="47">But if you do not believe what Moses wrote, how will you believe my words?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also called the Sea of Tiberias).</verse>
				<verse number="2">A large crowd was following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Jesus went on up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="4">(Now the Jewish feast of the Passover was near.)</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then Jesus, when he looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that these people may eat?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(Now Jesus said this to test him, for he knew what he was going to do.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">Philip replied, “Two hundred silver coins worth of bread would not be enough for them, for each one to get a little.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,</verse>
				<verse number="9">“Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what good are these for so many people?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” (Now there was a lot of grass in that place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed the bread to those who were seated. He then did the same with the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When they were all satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces that are left over, so that nothing is wasted.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by the people who had eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus performed, they began to say to one another, “This is certainly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then Jesus, because he knew they were going to come and seize him by force to make him king, withdrew again up the mountainside alone.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,</verse>
				<verse number="17">got into a boat, and started to cross the lake to Capernaum. (It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.)</verse>
				<verse number="18">By now a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake, approaching the boat, and they were frightened.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But he said to them, “It is I. Do not be afraid.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land where they had been heading.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one small boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But some boats from Tiberias came to shore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate all the loaves of bread you wanted.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Do not work for the food that disappears, but for the food that remains to eternal life — the food which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has put his seal of approval on him.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">So then they said to him, “What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires — to believe in the one whom he sent.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So they said to him, “Then what miraculous sign will you perform, so that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</verse>
				<verse number="31">Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then Jesus told them, “I tell you the solemn truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="33">For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">So they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time!”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never go hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty.</verse>
				<verse number="36">But I told you that you have seen me and still do not believe.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never send away.</verse>
				<verse number="38">For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now this is the will of the one who sent me — that I should not lose one person of every one he has given me, but raise them all up at the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For this is the will of my Father — for everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began complaining about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven,”</verse>
				<verse number="42">and they said, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</verse>
				<verse number="43">Jesus replied, “Do not complain about me to one another.</verse>
				<verse number="44">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="45">It is written in the prophets, ‘ And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God — he has seen the Father.)</verse>
				<verse number="47">I tell you the solemn truth, the one who believes has eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="48">I am the bread of life.</verse>
				<verse number="49">Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
				<verse number="50">This is the bread that has come down from heaven, so that a person may eat from it and not die.</verse>
				<verse number="51">I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began to argue with one another, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</verse>
				<verse number="53">Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="54">The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="55">For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</verse>
				<verse number="56">The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me, and I in him.</verse>
				<verse number="57">Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who consumes me will live because of me.</verse>
				<verse number="58">This is the bread that came down from heaven; it is not like the bread your ancestors ate, but then later died. The one who eats this bread will live forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
				<verse number="60">Then many of his disciples, when they heard these things, said, “This is a difficult saying! Who can understand it?”</verse>
				<verse number="61">When Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about this, he said to them, “Does this cause you to be offended?</verse>
				<verse number="62">Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</verse>
				<verse number="63">The Spirit is the one who gives life; human nature is of no help! The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
				<verse number="64">But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)</verse>
				<verse number="65">So Jesus added, “Because of this I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has allowed him to come.”</verse>
				<verse number="66">After this many of his disciples quit following him and did not accompany him any longer.</verse>
				<verse number="67">So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”</verse>
				<verse number="68">Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="69">We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="70">Jesus replied, “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is the devil?”</verse>
				<verse number="71">(Now he said this about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for Judas, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.)</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Jesus’ brothers advised him, “Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see your miracles that you are performing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For no one who seeks to make a reputation for himself does anything in secret. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">(For not even his own brothers believed in him.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">So Jesus replied, “My time has not yet arrived, but you are ready at any opportunity!</verse>
				<verse number="7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it that its deeds are evil.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You go up to the feast yourselves. I am not going up to this feast because my time has not yet fully arrived.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">When he had said this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus himself also went up, not openly but in secret.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the feast, asking, “Where is he?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others, “He deceives the common people.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When the feast was half over, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the Jewish leaders were astonished and said, “How does this man know so much when he has never had formal instruction?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Jesus replied, “My teaching is not from me, but from the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If anyone wants to do God’s will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak from my own authority.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The person who speaks on his own authority desires to receive honor for himself; the one who desires the honor of the one who sent him is a man of integrity, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Hasn’t Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law! Why do you want to kill me?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">The crowd answered, “You’re possessed by a demon! Who is trying to kill you?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Jesus replied, “I performed one miracle and you are all amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="22">However, because Moses gave you the practice of circumcision (not that it came from Moses, but from the forefathers), you circumcise a male child on the Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But if a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?</verse>
				<verse number="24">Do not judge according to external appearance, but judge with proper judgment.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then some of the residents of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to him. Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?</verse>
				<verse number="27">But we know where this man comes from. Whenever the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Jesus, while teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You both know me and know where I come from! And I have not come on my own initiative, but the one who sent me is true. You do not know him,</verse>
				<verse number="29">but I know him, because I have come from him and he sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So then they tried to seize Jesus, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Yet many of the crowd believed in him and said, “Whenever the Christ comes, he won’t perform more miraculous signs than this man did, will he?”</verse>
				<verse number="32">The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Jesus, so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then Jesus said, “I will be with you for only a little while longer, and then I am going to the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then the Jewish leaders said to one another, “Where is he going to go that we cannot find him? He is not going to go to the Jewish people dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
				<verse number="36">What did he mean by saying, ‘You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come’?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">On the last day of the feast, the greatest day, Jesus stood up and shouted out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and</verse>
				<verse number="38">let the one who believes in me drink. Just as the scripture says, ‘ From within him will flow rivers of living water.’”</verse>
				<verse number="39">(Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</verse>
				<verse number="40">When they heard these words, some of the crowd began to say, “This really is the Prophet!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Others said, “This is the Christ!” But still others said, “No, for the Christ doesn’t come from Galilee, does he?</verse>
				<verse number="42">Don’t the scriptures say that the Christ is a descendant of David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”</verse>
				<verse number="43">So there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him back with you?”</verse>
				<verse number="46">The officers replied, “No one ever spoke like this man!”</verse>
				<verse number="47">Then the Pharisees answered, “You haven’t been deceived too, have you?</verse>
				<verse number="48">None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they?</verse>
				<verse number="49">But this rabble who do not know the law are accursed!”</verse>
				<verse number="50">Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before and who was one of the rulers, said,</verse>
				<verse number="51">“Our law doesn’t condemn a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing, does it?”</verse>
				<verse number="52">They replied, “You aren’t from Galilee too, are you? Investigate carefully and you will see that no prophet comes from Galilee!” [[</verse>
				<verse number="53">And each one departed to his own house.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again. All the people came to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The experts in the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They made her stand in front of them</verse>
				<verse number="4">and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the law Moses commanded us to stone to death such women. What then do you say?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against him.) Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When they persisted in asking him, he stood up straight and replied, “Whoever among you is guiltless may be the first to throw a stone at her.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now when they heard this, they began to drift away one at a time, starting with the older ones, until Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus stood up straight and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">She replied, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.” ]]</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then Jesus spoke out again, “I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">So the Pharisees objected, “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus answered, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you people do not know where I came from or where I am going.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You people judge by outward appearances; I do not judge anyone.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if I judge, my evaluation is accurate, because I am not alone when I judge, but I and the Father who sent me do so together.</verse>
				<verse number="17">It is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then they began asking him, “Who is your father?” Jesus answered, “You do not know either me or my Father. If you knew me you would know my Father too.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">(Jesus spoke these words near the offering box while he was teaching in the temple courts. No one seized him because his time had not yet come.)</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then Jesus said to them again, “I am going away, and you will look for me but will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So the Jewish leaders began to say, “Perhaps he is going to kill himself, because he says, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “You people are from below; I am from above. You people are from this world; I am not from this world.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Thus I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus replied, “What I have told you from the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the Father who sent me is truthful, and the things I have heard from him I speak to the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">(They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.)</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative, but I speak just what the Father taught me.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do those things that please him.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">While he was saying these things, many people believed in him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then Jesus said to those Judeans who had believed him, “If you continue to follow my teaching, you are really my disciples</verse>
				<verse number="32">and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">“We are descendants of Abraham,” they replied, “and have never been anyone’s slaves! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="35">The slave does not remain in the family forever, but the son remains forever.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So if the son sets you free, you will be really free.</verse>
				<verse number="37">I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. But you want to kill me, because my teaching makes no progress among you.</verse>
				<verse number="38">I am telling you the things I have seen while with the Father; as for you, practice the things you have heard from the Father!”</verse>
				<verse number="39">They answered him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus replied, “If you are Abraham’s children, you would be doing the deeds of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="40">But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham did not do this!</verse>
				<verse number="41">You people are doing the deeds of your father.” Then they said to Jesus, “We were not born as a result of immorality! We have only one Father, God himself.”</verse>
				<verse number="42">Jesus replied, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come from God and am now here. I have not come on my own initiative, but he sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Why don’t you understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot accept my teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="44">You people are from your father the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
				<verse number="45">But because I am telling you the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Who among you can prove me guilty of any sin? If I am telling you the truth, why don’t you believe me?</verse>
				<verse number="47">The one who belongs to God listens and responds to God’s words. You don’t listen and respond, because you don’t belong to God.”</verse>
				<verse number="48">The Judeans replied, “Aren’t we correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Jesus answered, “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor my Father — and yet you dishonor me.</verse>
				<verse number="50">I am not trying to get praise for myself. There is one who demands it, and he also judges.</verse>
				<verse number="51">I tell you the solemn truth, if anyone obeys my teaching, he will never see death.”</verse>
				<verse number="52">Then the Judeans responded, “Now we know you’re possessed by a demon! Both Abraham and the prophets died, and yet you say, ‘If anyone obeys my teaching, he will never experience death.’</verse>
				<verse number="53">You aren’t greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died too! Who do you claim to be?”</verse>
				<verse number="54">Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is worthless. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you people say, ‘He is our God.’</verse>
				<verse number="55">Yet you do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</verse>
				<verse number="57">Then the Judeans replied, “You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?”</verse>
				<verse number="58">Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, before Abraham came into existence, I am!”</verse>
				<verse number="59">Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple area.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Now as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.</verse>
				<verse number="2">His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind, this man or his parents?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but he was born blind so that the acts of God may be revealed through what happens to him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We must perform the deeds of the one who sent me as long as it is daytime. Night is coming when no one can work.</verse>
				<verse number="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Having said this, he spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva. He smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes</verse>
				<verse number="7">and said to him, “Go wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “sent”). So the blind man went away and washed, and came back seeing.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously as a beggar began saying, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Some people said, “This is the man!” while others said, “No, but he looks like him.” The man himself kept insisting, “I am the one!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So they asked him, “How then were you made to see?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">He replied, “The man called Jesus made mud, smeared it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went and washed, and was able to see.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They said to him, “Where is that man?” He replied, “I don’t know.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
				<verse number="14">(Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath.)</verse>
				<verse number="15">So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight. He replied, “He put mud on my eyes and I washed, and now I am able to see.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then some of the Pharisees began to say, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such miraculous signs?” Thus there was a division among them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So again they asked the man who used to be blind, “What do you say about him, since he caused you to see?” “He is a prophet,” the man replied.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now the Jewish religious leaders refused to believe that he had really been blind and had gained his sight until at last they summoned the parents of the man who had become able to see.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They asked the parents, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">So his parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But we do not know how he is now able to see, nor do we know who caused him to see. Ask him, he is a mature adult. He will speak for himself.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">(His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders. For the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For this reason his parents said, “He is a mature adult, ask him.”)</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then they summoned the man who used to be blind a second time and said to him, “Promise before God to tell the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">He replied, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. I do know one thing — that although I was blind, now I can see.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he cause you to see?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">He answered, “I told you already and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You people don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?”</verse>
				<verse number="28">They heaped insults on him, saying, “You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</verse>
				<verse number="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses! We do not know where this man comes from!”</verse>
				<verse number="30">The man replied, “This is a remarkable thing, that you don’t know where he comes from, and yet he caused me to see!</verse>
				<verse number="31">We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is devout and does his will, God listens to him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see.</verse>
				<verse number="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">They replied, “You were born completely in sinfulness, and yet you presume to teach us?” So they threw him out.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, so he found the man and said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The man replied, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Jesus told him, “You have seen him; he is the one speaking with you.” [</verse>
				<verse number="38">He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus said,] “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight, and the ones who see may become blind.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him, “We are not blind too, are we?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Jesus replied, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When he has brought all his own sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Jesus said to them again, “I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door for the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="8">All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and find pasture.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep, he runs away.</verse>
				<verse number="14">“I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me —</verse>
				<verse number="15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This is why the Father loves me — because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again.</verse>
				<verse number="18">No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This commandment I received from my Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Others said, “These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. A demon cannot cause the blind to see, can it?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="23">It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus replied, “I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="27">My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.</verse>
				<verse number="29">My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The Father and I are one.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?”</verse>
				<verse number="33">The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘ I said, you are gods ’?</verse>
				<verse number="35">If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
				<verse number="36">do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</verse>
				<verse number="37">If I do not perform the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Many came to him and began to say, “John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!”</verse>
				<verse number="42">And many believed in Jesus there.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived.</verse>
				<verse number="2">(Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, look, the one you love is sick.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not lead to death, but to God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he remained in the place where he was for two more days.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then after this, he said to his disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">The disciples replied, “Rabbi, the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death! Are you going there again?”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks around in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But if anyone walks around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">After he said this, he added, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. But I am going there to awaken him.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the disciples replied, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">(Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.)</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died,</verse>
				<verse number="15">and I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Thomas (called Didymus ) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already.</verse>
				<verse number="18">(Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="19">so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother.)</verse>
				<verse number="20">So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “Your brother will come back to life again.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Martha said, “I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies,</verse>
				<verse number="26">and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">She replied, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">And when she had said this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, saying privately, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">So when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">(Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him.)</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out. They followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping, he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He asked, “Where have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus wept.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Thus the people who had come to mourn said, “Look how much he loved him!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But some of them said, “This is the man who caused the blind man to see! Couldn’t he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus, intensely moved again, came to the tomb. (Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed across it.)</verse>
				<verse number="39">Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, replied, “Lord, by this time the body will have a bad smell, because he has been buried four days.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Jesus responded, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you would see the glory of God?”</verse>
				<verse number="41">So they took away the stone. Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you that you have listened to me.</verse>
				<verse number="42">I knew that you always listen to me, but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here, that they may believe that you sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="43">When he had said this, he shouted in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</verse>
				<verse number="44">The one who had died came out, his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth, and a cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them, “Unwrap him and let him go.”</verse>
				<verse number="45">Then many of the people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him.</verse>
				<verse number="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done.</verse>
				<verse number="47">So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many miraculous signs.</verse>
				<verse number="48">If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation.”</verse>
				<verse number="49">Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said, “You know nothing at all!</verse>
				<verse number="50">You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish.”</verse>
				<verse number="51">(Now he did not say this on his own, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation,</verse>
				<verse number="52">and not for the Jewish nation only, but to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered.)</verse>
				<verse number="53">So from that day they planned together to kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="55">Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, and many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Thus they were looking for Jesus, and saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he won’t come to the feast?”</verse>
				<verse number="57">(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the table with him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair. (Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.)</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">(Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)</verse>
				<verse number="7">So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too,</verse>
				<verse number="11">for on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. They began to shout, “ Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ Do not be afraid, people of Zion; look, your king is coming, seated on a donkey ’ s colt! ”</verse>
				<verse number="16">(His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him.)</verse>
				<verse number="17">So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign, the crowd went out to meet him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Thus the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you can do nothing. Look, the world has run off after him!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Philip went and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I tell you the solemn truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The one who loves his life destroys it, and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="26">If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow me, and where I am, my servant will be too. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Now my soul is greatly distressed. And what should I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? No, but for this very reason I have come to this hour.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Jesus said, “This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">(Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die.)</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the crowd responded, “We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever. How can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Jesus replied, “The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
				<verse number="36">While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.” When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to believe in him,</verse>
				<verse number="38">so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled. He said, “ Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? ”</verse>
				<verse number="39">For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,</verse>
				<verse number="40">“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and turn to me, and I would heal them.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory, and spoke about him.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="43">For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</verse>
				<verse number="44">But Jesus shouted out, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,</verse>
				<verse number="45">and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="46">I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="47">If anyone hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
				<verse number="48">The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge; the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day.</verse>
				<verse number="49">For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
				<verse number="50">And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Thus the things I say, I say just as the Father has told me.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Just before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now loved them to the very end.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,</verse>
				<verse number="4">he got up from the meal, removed his outer clothes, took a towel and tied it around himself.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Jesus replied, “You do not understand what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus replied, “The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not every one of you.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">(For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said, “Not every one of you is clean.” )</verse>
				<verse number="12">So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he took his place at the table again and said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?</verse>
				<verse number="13">You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another’s feet.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I have given you an example — you should do just as I have done for you.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I tell you the solemn truth, the slave is not greater than his master, nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If you understand these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“What I am saying does not refer to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture, ‘ The one who eats my bread has turned against me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am he.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I tell you the solemn truth, whoever accepts the one I send accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit, and testified, “I tell you the solemn truth, one of you will betray me.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The disciples began to look at one another, worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about.</verse>
				<verse number="23">One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor.</verse>
				<verse number="24">So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him, “Lord, who is it?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Jesus replied, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.” Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">(Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.)</verse>
				<verse number="30">Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately. (Now it was night.)</verse>
				<verse number="31">When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him right away.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Children, I am still with you for a little while. You will look for me, and just as I said to the Jewish religious leaders, ‘Where I am going you cannot come,’ now I tell you the same.</verse>
				<verse number="34">“I give you a new commandment — to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Everyone will know by this that you are my disciples — if you have love for one another.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you the solemn truth, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">“Do not let your hearts be distressed. You believe in God; believe also in me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There are many dwelling places in my Father’s house. Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going away to make ready a place for you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come again and take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be too.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And you know the way where I am going.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Thomas said, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus replied, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If you have known me, you will know my Father too. And from now on you do know him and have seen him.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be content.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Jesus replied, “Have I been with you for so long, and you have not known me, Philip? The person who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.</verse>
				<verse number="15">“If you love me, you will obey my commandments.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever —</verse>
				<verse number="17">the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, because it does not see him or know him. But you know him, because he resides with you and will be in you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“I will not abandon you as orphans, I will come to you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In a little while the world will not see me any longer, but you will see me; because I live, you will live too.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You will know at that time that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Lord,” Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “If anyone loves me, he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and take up residence with him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The person who does not love me does not obey my words. And the word you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I have spoken these things while staying with you.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and will cause you to remember everything I said to you.</verse>
				<verse number="27">“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; I do not give it to you as the world does. Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I have told you now before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.</verse>
				<verse number="30">I will not speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,</verse>
				<verse number="31">but I am doing just what the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up, let us go from here.”</verse>

				<verse number="1">“I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.</verse>

				<verse number="3">You are clean already because of the word that I have spoken to you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me — and I in him — bears much fruit, because apart from me you can accomplish nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">My Father is honored by this, that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples.</verse>

				<verse number="12">My commandment is this — to love one another just as I have loved you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">No one has greater love than this — that one lays down his life for his friends.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You are my friends if you do what I command you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I no longer call you slaves, because the slave does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father.</verse>
				<verse number="16">You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that remains, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This I command you — to love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="18">“If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me first.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you do not belong to the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Remember what I told you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my word, they will obey yours too.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But they no longer have any excuse for their sin.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The one who hates me hates my Father too.</verse>
				<verse number="24">If I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father.</verse>

				<verse number="26">When the Advocate comes, whom I will send you from the Father — the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father — he will testify about me,</verse>

				<verse number="18">So they kept on repeating, “What is the meaning of what he says, ‘In a little while’? We do not understand what he is talking about.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things, so he said to them, “Are you asking each other about this — that I said, ‘In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me’?</verse>
				<verse number="20">I tell you the solemn truth, you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy.</verse>
				<verse number="21">When a woman gives birth, she has distress because her time has come, but when her child is born, she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">At that time you will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="26">At that time you will ask in my name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">I came from the Father and entered into the world, but in turn, I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">His disciples said, “Look, now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything. Because of this we believe that you have come from God.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Jesus replied, “Do you now believe?</verse>
				<verse number="32">Look, a time is coming — and has come — when you will be scattered, each one to his own home, and I will be left alone. Yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.</verse>

				<verse number="1">When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you —</verse>

				<verse number="6">“I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word.</verse>

				<verse number="16">They do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Set them apart in the truth; your word is truth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Just as you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And I set myself apart on their behalf, so that they too may be truly set apart.</verse>
				<verse number="20">“I am not praying only on their behalf, but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their testimony,</verse>
				<verse number="21">that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray that they will be in us, so that the world will believe that you sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The glory you gave to me I have given to them, that they may be one just as we are one —</verse>
				<verse number="23">I in them and you in me — that they may be completely one, so that the world will know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">“Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they can see my glory that you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Righteous Father, even if the world does not know you, I know you, and these men know that you sent me.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I made known your name to them, and I will continue to make it known, so that the love you have loved me with may be in them, and I may be in them.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an orchard there, and he and his disciples went into it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">(Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples.)</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers and some officers of the chief priests and Pharisees. They came to the orchard with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Jesus, because he knew everything that was going to happen to him, came and asked them, “Who are you looking for?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">They replied, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He told them, “I am he.” (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">So when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they retreated and fell to the ground.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken, “I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. (Now the slave’s name was Malchus.)</verse>
				<verse number="11">But Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
				<verse number="14">(Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was to their advantage that one man die for the people.)</verse>
				<verse number="15">Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard.)</verse>
				<verse number="16">But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door, and brought Peter inside.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, “You’re not one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” He replied, “I am not.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">(Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire they had made, warming themselves because it was cold. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.)</verse>
				<verse number="19">While this was happening, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Jesus replied, “I have spoken publicly to the world. I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts, where all the Jewish people assemble together. I have said nothing in secret.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said. They know what I said.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">When Jesus had said this, one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby struck him on the face and said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Jesus replied, “If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why strike me?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Annas sent him, still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself. They said to him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?” Peter denied it: “I am not!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">One of the high priest’s slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the orchard with him?”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence. (Now it was very early morning.) They did not go into the governor’s residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled, but could eat the Passover meal.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">They replied, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">Pilate told them, “Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law!” The Jewish leaders replied, “We cannot legally put anyone to death.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">(This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going to die. )</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Jesus replied, “Are you saying this on your own initiative, or have others told you about me?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Then Pilate said, “So you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world — to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Pilate asked, “What is truth?” When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders and announced, “I find no basis for an accusation against him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But it is your custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then they shouted back, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary. )</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They came up to him again and again and said, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they struck him repeatedly in the face.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Again Pilate went out and said to the Jewish leaders, “Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no reason for an accusation against him.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Look, here is the man!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">When the chief priests and their officers saw him, they shouted out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said, “You take him and crucify him! Certainly I find no reason for an accusation against him!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">The Jewish leaders replied, “We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When Pilate heard what they said, he was more afraid than ever,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and he went back into the governor’s residence and said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So Pilate said, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have the authority to release you, and to crucify you?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Jesus replied, “You would have no authority over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">From this point on, Pilate tried to release him. But the Jewish leaders shouted out, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar! Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called “The Stone Pavement” ( Gabbatha in Aramaic).</verse>
				<verse number="14">(Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, about noon. ) Pilate said to the Jewish leaders, “Look, here is your king!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then they shouted out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate asked, “Shall I crucify your king?” The high priests replied, “We have no king except Caesar!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and carrying his own cross he went out to the place called “The Place of the Skull” (called in Aramaic Golgotha ).</verse>
				<verse number="18">There they crucified him along with two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross, which read: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The king of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am king of the Jews.’”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and made four shares, one for each soldier, and the tunic remained. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from top to bottom as a single piece.)</verse>
				<verse number="24">So the soldiers said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but throw dice to see who will get it.” This took place to fulfill the scripture that says, “ They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they threw dice.” So the soldiers did these things.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, look, here is your son!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">He then said to his disciple, “Look, here is your mother!” From that very time the disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
				<verse number="28">After this Jesus, realizing that by this time everything was completed, said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">A jar full of sour wine was there, so they put a sponge soaked in sour wine on a branch of hyssop and lifted it to his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed!” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important one), the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus, first the one and then the other.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out immediately.</verse>
				<verse number="35">And the person who saw it has testified (and his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth), so that you also may believe.</verse>
				<verse number="36">For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled, “ Not a bone of his will be broken.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">And again another scripture says, “ They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”</verse>
				<verse number="38">After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders ), asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he went and took the body away.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Nicodemus, the man who had previously come to Jesus at night, accompanied Joseph, carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it, with the aromatic spices, in strips of linen cloth according to Jewish burial customs.</verse>
				<verse number="41">Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And so, because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus’ body there.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Now very early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The two were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and went right into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and the face cloth, which had been around Jesus’ head, not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, came in, and he saw and believed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">(For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">So the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent down and looked into the tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” Mary replied, “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Because she thought he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “ Rabboni ” (which means Teacher).</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus replied, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.</verse>
				<verse number="19">On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the disciples had gathered together and locked the doors of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">And after he said this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the wounds from the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and examine my hands. Extend your hand and put it into my side. Do not continue in your unbelief, but believe.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Thomas replied to him, “My Lord and my God!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now this is how he did so.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael (who was from Cana in Galilee), the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of his were together.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” “We will go with you,” they replied. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When it was already very early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Jesus said to them, “Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?” They replied, “No.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">He told them, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw the net, and were not able to pull it in because of the large number of fish.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tucked in his outer garment (for he had nothing on underneath it), and plunged into the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Meanwhile the other disciples came with the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.</verse>
				<verse number="9">When they got out on the beach, they saw a charcoal fire ready with a fish placed on it, and bread.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you have just now caught.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore. It was full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three, but although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said. But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</verse>
				<verse number="14">This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these do?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Jesus said a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Jesus said a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time, “Do you love me?” and said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I tell you the solemn truth, when you were young, you tied your clothes around you and went wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others will tie you up and bring you where you do not want to go.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">(Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God.) After he said this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. (This was the disciple who had leaned back against Jesus’ chest at the meal and asked, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”)</verse>
				<verse number="21">So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Jesus replied, “If I want him to live until I come back, what concern is that of yours? You follow me!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the saying circulated among the brothers and sisters that this disciple was not going to die. But Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, but rather, “If I want him to live until I come back, what concern is that of yours?”</verse>
				<verse number="24">This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
				<verse number="25">There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="44">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">I wrote the former account, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach</verse>
				<verse number="2">until the day he was taken up to heaven, after he had given orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
				<verse number="3">To the same apostles also, after his suffering, he presented himself alive with many convincing proofs. He was seen by them over a forty-day period and spoke about matters concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">While he was with them, he declared, “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait there for what my Father promised, which you heard about from me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So when they had gathered together, they began to ask him, “Lord, is this the time when you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”</verse>
				<verse number="7">He told them, “You are not permitted to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest parts of the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">After he had said this, while they were watching, he was lifted up and a cloud hid him from their sight.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As they were still staring into the sky while he was going, suddenly two men in white clothing stood near them</verse>
				<verse number="11">and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking up into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come back in the same way you saw him go into heaven.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Mount of Olives (which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away).</verse>
				<verse number="13">When they had entered Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room where they were staying. Peter and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James were there.</verse>
				<verse number="14">All these continued together in prayer with one mind, together with the women, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty people) and said,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“Brothers, the scripture had to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit foretold through David concerning Judas — who became the guide for those who arrested Jesus —</verse>
				<verse number="17">for he was counted as one of us and received a share in this ministry.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">(Now this man Judas acquired a field with the reward of his unjust deed, and falling headfirst he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.</verse>
				<verse number="19">This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so that in their own language they called that field Hakeldama, that is, “Field of Blood.”)</verse>
				<verse number="20">“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘ Let his house become deserted, and let there be no one to live in it,’ and ‘ Let another take his position of responsibility.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">Thus one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time the Lord Jesus associated with us,</verse>
				<verse number="22">beginning from his baptism by John until the day he was taken up from us — one of these must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So they proposed two candidates: Joseph called Barsabbas (also called Justus) and Matthias.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all. Show us which one of these two you have chosen</verse>
				<verse number="25">to assume the task of this service and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then they cast lots for them, and the one chosen was Matthias; so he was counted with the eleven apostles.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Completely baffled, they said, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
				<verse number="8">And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia,</verse>
				<verse number="10">Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,</verse>
				<verse number="11">both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs — we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">All were astounded and greatly confused, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But others jeered at the speakers, saying, “They are drunk on new wine!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “You men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this and listen carefully to what I say.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In spite of what you think, these men are not drunk, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel:</verse>
				<verse number="17">‘ And in the last days it will be, ’ God says, ‘ that I will pour out my Spirit on all people, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And I will perform wonders in the sky above and miraculous signs on the earth below, blood and fire and clouds of smoke.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The sun will be changed to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’</verse>
				<verse number="22">“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man clearly attested to you by God with powerful deeds, wonders, and miraculous signs that God performed among you through him, just as you yourselves know —</verse>
				<verse number="23">this man, who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But God raised him up, having released him from the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held in its power.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For David says about him, ‘ I saw the Lord always in front of me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced; my body also will live in hope,</verse>
				<verse number="27">because you will not leave my soul in Hades, nor permit your Holy One to experience decay.</verse>
				<verse number="28">You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of joy with your presence.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">“Brothers, I can speak confidently to you about our forefather David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So then, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne,</verse>
				<verse number="31">David by foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his body experience decay.</verse>
				<verse number="32">This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So then, exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you both see and hear.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, ‘ The Lord said to my lord, “ Sit at my right hand</verse>
				<verse number="35">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’</verse>
				<verse number="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Now when they heard this, they were acutely distressed and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “What should we do, brothers?”</verse>
				<verse number="38">Peter said to them, “Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="39">For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">With many other words he testified and exhorted them saying, “Save yourselves from this perverse generation!”</verse>
				<verse number="41">So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added.</verse>
				<verse number="42">They were devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Reverential awe came over everyone, and many wonders and miraculous signs came about by the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="44">All who believed were together and held everything in common,</verse>
				<verse number="45">and they began selling their property and possessions and distributing the proceeds to everyone, as anyone had need.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Every day they continued to gather together by common consent in the temple courts, breaking bread from house to house, sharing their food with glad and humble hearts,</verse>
				<verse number="47">praising God and having the good will of all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number every day those who were being saved.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time for prayer, at three o’clock in the afternoon.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And a man lame from birth was being carried up, who was placed at the temple gate called “the Beautiful Gate” every day so he could beg for money from those going into the temple courts.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he asked them for money.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Peter looked directly at him (as did John) and said, “Look at us!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So the lame man paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, stand up and walk!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Peter took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up, and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He jumped up, stood and began walking around, and he entered the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">All the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and they recognized him as the man who used to sit and ask for donations at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with astonishment and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">While the man was hanging on to Peter and John, all the people, completely astounded, ran together to them in the covered walkway called Solomon’s Portico.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Peter saw this, he declared to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you stare at us as if we had made this man walk by our own power or piety?</verse>
				<verse number="13">The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate after he had decided to release him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be released to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You killed the Originator of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this fact we are witnesses!</verse>
				<verse number="16">And on the basis of faith in Jesus’ name, his very name has made this man — whom you see and know — strong. The faith that is through Jesus has given him this complete health in the presence of you all.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And now, brothers, I know you acted in ignorance, as your rulers did too.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But the things God foretold long ago through all the prophets — that his Christ would suffer — he has fulfilled in this way.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out,</verse>
				<verse number="20">so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and so that he may send the Messiah appointed for you — that is, Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">This one heaven must receive until the time all things are restored, which God declared from times long ago through his holy prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Moses said, ‘ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must obey him in everything he tells you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Every person who does not obey that prophet will be destroyed and thus removed from the people.’</verse>
				<verse number="24">And all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed him, have spoken about and announced these days.</verse>
				<verse number="25">You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘ And in your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’</verse>
				<verse number="26">God raised up his servant and sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each one of you from your iniquities.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the commander of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,</verse>
				<verse number="2">angry because they were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So they seized them and put them in jail until the next day (for it was already evening).</verse>
				<verse number="4">But many of those who had listened to the message believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On the next day, their rulers, elders, and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest’s family.</verse>
				<verse number="7">After making Peter and John stand in their midst, they began to inquire, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, replied, “Rulers of the people and elders,</verse>
				<verse number="9">if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a sick man — by what means this man was healed —</verse>
				<verse number="10">let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, this man stands before you healthy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, that has become the cornerstone.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">When they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and discovered that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized these men had been with Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And because they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against this.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when they had ordered them to go outside the council, they began to confer with one another,</verse>
				<verse number="16">saying, “What should we do with these men? For it is plain to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable miraculous sign has come about through them, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">And they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right before God to obey you rather than God, you decide,</verse>
				<verse number="20">for it is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">After threatening them further, they released them, for they could not find how to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the man, on whom this miraculous sign of healing had been performed, was over forty years old.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When they were released, Peter and John went to their fellow believers and reported everything the high priests and the elders had said to them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When they heard this, they raised their voices to God with one mind and said, “Master of all, you who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,</verse>
				<verse number="25">who said by the Holy Spirit through your servant David our forefather, ‘ Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot foolish things?</verse>
				<verse number="26">The kings of the earth stood together, and the rulers assembled together, against the Lord and against his Christ.’</verse>
				<verse number="27">“For indeed both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,</verse>
				<verse number="28">to do as much as your power and your plan had decided beforehand would happen.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And now, Lord, pay attention to their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your message with great courage,</verse>
				<verse number="30">while you extend your hand to heal, and to bring about miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God courageously.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The group of those who believed were of one heart and mind, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own, but everything was held in common.</verse>
				<verse number="33">With great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For there was no one needy among them, because those who were owners of land or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds from the sales</verse>
				<verse number="35">and placing them at the apostles’ feet. The proceeds were distributed to each, as anyone had need.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So Joseph, a Levite who was a native of Cyprus, called by the apostles Barnabas (which is translated “son of encouragement”),</verse>
				<verse number="37">sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now a man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He kept back for himself part of the proceeds with his wife’s knowledge; he brought only part of it and placed it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back for yourself part of the proceeds from the sale of the land?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Before it was sold, did it not belong to you? And when it was sold, was the money not at your disposal? How have you thought up this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people but to God!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When Ananias heard these words he collapsed and died, and great fear gripped all who heard about it.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the young men came, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, but she did not know what had happened.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Peter said to her, “Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the land?” Sapphira said, “Yes, that much.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Peter then told her, “Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">At once she collapsed at his feet and died. So when the young men came in, they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Great fear gripped the whole church and all who heard about these things.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now many miraculous signs and wonders came about among the people through the hands of the apostles. By common consent they were all meeting together in Solomon’s Portico.</verse>
				<verse number="13">None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high honor.</verse>
				<verse number="14">More and more believers in the Lord were added to their number, crowds of both men and women.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Thus they even carried the sick out into the streets, and put them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow would fall on some of them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">A crowd of people from the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits. They were all being healed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now the high priest rose up, and all those with him (that is, the religious party of the Sadducees ), and they were filled with jealousy.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, led them out, and said,</verse>
				<verse number="20">“Go and stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people all the words of this life.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">When they heard this, they entered the temple courts at daybreak and began teaching. Now when the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin — that is, the whole high council of the Israelites — and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought before them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the officers who came for them did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,</verse>
				<verse number="23">“We found the jail locked securely and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now when the commander of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this report, they were greatly puzzled concerning it, wondering what this could be.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But someone came and reported to them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courts and teaching the people!”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then the commander of the temple guard went with the officers and brought the apostles without the use of force (for they were afraid of being stoned by the people).</verse>
				<verse number="27">When they had brought them, they stood them before the council, and the high priest questioned them,</verse>
				<verse number="28">saying, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name. Look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood on us!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">But Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom you seized and killed by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
				<verse number="31">God exalted him to his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And we are witnesses of these events, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now when they heard this, they became furious and wanted to execute them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the council and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Then he said to the council, “Men of Israel, pay close attention to what you are about to do to these men.</verse>
				<verse number="36">For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and nothing came of it.</verse>
				<verse number="37">After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census, and incited people to follow him in revolt. He too was killed, and all who followed him were scattered.</verse>
				<verse number="38">So in this case I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone, because if this plan or this undertaking originates with people, it will come to nothing,</verse>
				<verse number="39">but if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them, or you may even be found fighting against God.” He convinced them,</verse>
				<verse number="40">and they summoned the apostles and had them beaten. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them.</verse>
				<verse number="41">So they left the council rejoicing because they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.</verse>
				<verse number="42">And every day both in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now in those days, when the disciples were growing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Greek-speaking Jews against the native Hebraic Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the twelve called the whole group of the disciples together and said, “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to wait on tables.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But carefully select from among you, brothers, seven men who are well-attested, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this necessary task.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The proposal pleased the entire group, so they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They stood these men before the apostles, who prayed and placed their hands on them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The word of God continued to spread, the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a large group of priests became obedient to the faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But some men from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, as well as some from Cilicia and the province of Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Yet they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they secretly instigated some men to say, “We have heard this man speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They incited the people, the elders, and the experts in the law; then they approached Stephen, seized him, and brought him before the council.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They brought forward false witnesses who said, “This man does not stop saying things against this holy place and the law.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we have heard him saying that Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">All who were sitting in the council looked intently at Stephen and saw his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Then the high priest said, “Are these things true?”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So he replied, “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and said to him, ‘ Go out from your country and from your relatives, and come to the land I will show you.’</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God made him move to this country where you now live.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He did not give any of it to him for an inheritance, not even a foot of ground, yet God promised to give it to him as his possession, and to his descendants after him, even though Abraham as yet had no child.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But God spoke as follows: ‘Your descendants will be foreigners in a foreign country, whose citizens will enslave them and mistreat them for four hundred years.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ said God, ‘ and after these things they will come out of there and worship me in this place.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him when he was eight days old, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The patriarchs, because they were jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and rescued him from all his troubles, and granted him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then a famine occurred throughout Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there the first time.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers again, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So Joseph sent a message and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come, seventy-five people in all.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So Jacob went down to Egypt and died there, along with our ancestors,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and their bones were later moved to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a certain sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</verse>
				<verse number="17">“But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham, the people increased greatly in number in Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="18">until another king who did not know about Joseph ruled over Egypt.</verse>
				<verse number="19">This was the one who exploited our people and was cruel to our ancestors, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die.</verse>
				<verse number="20">At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. For three months he was brought up in his father’s house,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and when he had been abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But when he was about forty years old, it entered his mind to visit his fellow countrymen the Israelites.</verse>
				<verse number="24">When he saw one of them being hurt unfairly, Moses came to his defense and avenged the person who was mistreated by striking down the Egyptian.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He thought his own people would understand that God was delivering them through him, but they did not understand.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The next day Moses saw two men fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why are you hurting one another?’</verse>
				<verse number="27">But the man who was unfairly hurting his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, ‘ Who made you a ruler and judge over us?</verse>
				<verse number="28">You don’t want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you? ’</verse>
				<verse number="29">When the man said this, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</verse>
				<verse number="30">“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to investigate, there came the voice of the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="32">‘ I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look more closely.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But the Lord said to him, ‘ Take the sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</verse>
				<verse number="34">I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.’</verse>
				<verse number="35">This same Moses they had rejected, saying, ‘ Who made you a ruler and judge? ’ God sent as both ruler and deliverer through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
				<verse number="36">This man led them out, performing wonders and miraculous signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</verse>
				<verse number="37">This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’</verse>
				<verse number="38">This is the man who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and he received living oracles to give to you.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him, but pushed him aside and turned back to Egypt in their hearts,</verse>
				<verse number="40">saying to Aaron, ‘ Make us gods who will go in front of us, for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt — we do not know what has happened to him! ’</verse>
				<verse number="41">At that time they made an idol in the form of a calf, brought a sacrifice to the idol, and began rejoicing in the works of their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="42">But God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: ‘ It was not to me that you offered slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, was it, house of Israel?</verse>
				<verse number="43">But you took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, the images you made to worship, but I will deport you beyond Babylon.’</verse>
				<verse number="44">Our ancestors had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as God who spoke to Moses ordered him to make it according to the design he had seen.</verse>
				<verse number="45">Our ancestors received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, until the time of David.</verse>
				<verse number="46">He found favor with God and asked that he could find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="47">But Solomon built a house for him.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Yet the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says,</verse>
				<verse number="49">‘ Heaven is my throne, and earth is the footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my resting place?</verse>
				<verse number="50">Did my hand not make all these things? ’</verse>
				<verse number="51">“You stubborn people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always resisting the Holy Spirit, like your ancestors did!</verse>
				<verse number="52">Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold long ago the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become!</verse>
				<verse number="53">You received the law by decrees given by angels, but you did not obey it.”</verse>
				<verse number="54">When they heard these things, they became furious and ground their teeth at him.</verse>
				<verse number="55">But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently toward heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</verse>
				<verse number="56">“Look!” he said. “I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</verse>
				<verse number="57">But they covered their ears, shouting out with a loud voice, and rushed at him with one intent.</verse>
				<verse number="58">When they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul.</verse>
				<verse number="59">They continued to stone Stephen while he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”</verse>
				<verse number="60">Then he fell to his knees and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died.</verse>

				<verse number="1">And Saul agreed completely with killing him. Now on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were forced to scatter throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But Saul was trying to destroy the church; entering one house after another, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now those who had been forced to scatter went around proclaiming the good news of the word.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what Philip said, as they heard and saw the miraculous signs he was performing.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, were coming out of many who were possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So there was great joy in that city.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now in that city was a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic and amazing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.</verse>
				<verse number="10">All the people, from the least to the greatest, paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And they paid close attention to him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they began to be baptized, both men and women.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he stayed close to Philip constantly, and when he saw the signs and great miracles that were occurring, he was amazed.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">These two went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="16">(For the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then Peter and John placed their hands on the Samaritans, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, offered them money,</verse>
				<verse number="19">saying, “Give me this power too, so that everyone I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire God’s gift with money!</verse>
				<verse number="21">You have no share or part in this matter because your heart is not right before God!</verse>
				<verse number="22">Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that he may perhaps forgive you for the intent of your heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For I see that you are bitterly envious and in bondage to sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">But Simon replied, “You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">So after Peter and John had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many Samaritan villages as they went.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)</verse>
				<verse number="27">So he got up and went. There he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship,</verse>
				<verse number="28">and was returning home, sitting in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So Philip ran up to it and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. He asked him, “Do you understand what you’re reading?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">The man replied, “How in the world can I, unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now the passage of scripture the man was reading was this: “ He was led like a sheep to slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="33">In humiliation justice was taken from him. Who can describe his posterity? For his life was taken away from the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then the eunuch said to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet saying this about — himself or someone else?”</verse>
				<verse number="35">So Philip started speaking, and beginning with this scripture proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Now as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look, there is water! What is to stop me from being baptized?”</verse>
				<verse number="37">***</verse>
				<verse number="38">So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, but went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Philip, however, found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through the area, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Meanwhile Saul, still breathing out threats to murder the Lord’s disciples, went to the high priest</verse>
				<verse number="2">and requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, either men or women, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="3">As he was going along, approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” He replied, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting!</verse>
				<verse number="6">But stand up and enter the city and you will be told what you must do.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">(Now the men who were traveling with him stood there speechless, because they heard the voice but saw no one.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open, he could see nothing. Leading him by the hand, his companions brought him into Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For three days he could not see, and he neither ate nor drank anything.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias,” and he replied, “Here I am, Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the Lord told him, “Get up and go to the street called ‘Straight,’ and at Judas’ house look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. For he is praying,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him so that he may see again.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and here he has authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call on your name!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles and kings and the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">So Ananias departed and entered the house, placed his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and after taking some food, his strength returned. For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus,</verse>
				<verse number="20">and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “This man is the Son of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">All who heard him were amazed and were saying, “Is this not the man who in Jerusalem was ravaging those who call on this name, and who had come here to bring them as prisoners to the chief priests?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But Saul became more and more capable, and was causing consternation among the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now after some days had passed, the Jews plotted together to kill him,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but Saul learned of their plot against him. They were also watching the city gates day and night so that they could kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But his disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall by lowering him in a basket.</verse>
				<verse number="26">When he arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But Barnabas took Saul, brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So he was staying with them, associating openly with them in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were trying to kill him.</verse>
				<verse number="30">When the brothers found out about this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced peace and thus was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, the church increased in numbers.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now as Peter was traveling around from place to place, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda.</verse>
				<verse number="33">He found there a man named Aeneas who had been confined to a mattress for eight years because he was paralyzed.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Get up and make your own bed!” And immediately he got up.</verse>
				<verse number="35">All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which in translation means Dorcas). She was continually doing good deeds and acts of charity.</verse>
				<verse number="37">At that time she became sick and died. When they had washed her body, they placed it in an upstairs room.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Because Lydda was near Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Come to us without delay.”</verse>
				<verse number="39">So Peter got up and went with them, and when he arrived they brought him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, crying and showing him the tunics and other clothing Dorcas used to make while she was with them.</verse>
				<verse number="40">But Peter sent them all outside, knelt down, and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He gave her his hand and helped her get up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive.</verse>
				<verse number="42">This became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="43">So Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a man named Simon, a tanner.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He was a devout, God-fearing man, as was all his household; he did many acts of charity for the people and prayed to God regularly.</verse>
				<verse number="3">About three o’clock one afternoon he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him, “Cornelius.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid, Cornelius replied, “What is it, Lord?” The angel said to him, “Your prayers and your acts of charity have gone up as a memorial before God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">When the angel who had spoken to him departed, Cornelius called two of his personal servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and when he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
				<verse number="9">About noon the next day, while they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing the meal, a trance came over him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down to earth by its four corners.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and wild birds.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then a voice said to him, “Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">The voice spoke to him again, a second time, “What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now while Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen could signify, the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon’s house was and approached the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They called out to ask if Simon, known as Peter, was staying there as a guest.</verse>
				<verse number="19">While Peter was still thinking seriously about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are looking for you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But get up, go down, and accompany them without hesitation, because I have sent them.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So Peter went down to the men and said, “Here I am, the person you’re looking for. Why have you come?”</verse>
				<verse number="22">They said, “Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So Peter invited them in and entertained them as guests. On the next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So when Peter came in, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up. I too am a mere mortal.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Peter continued talking with him as he went in, and he found many people gathered together.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He said to them, “You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile, yet God has shown me that I should call no person defiled or ritually unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Therefore when you sent for me, I came without any objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”</verse>
				<verse number="30">Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, at three o’clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my house, and suddenly a man in shining clothing stood before me</verse>
				<verse number="31">and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity have been remembered before God.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’</verse>
				<verse number="33">Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come. So now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to say to us.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Then Peter started speaking: “I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism in dealing with people,</verse>
				<verse number="35">but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him.</verse>
				<verse number="36">You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all) —</verse>
				<verse number="37">you know what happened throughout Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced:</verse>
				<verse number="38">with respect to Jesus from Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">We are witnesses of all the things he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,</verse>
				<verse number="41">not by all the people, but by us, the witnesses God had already chosen, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="42">He commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="43">About him all the prophets testify, that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</verse>
				<verse number="44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the message.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were greatly astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,</verse>
				<verse number="46">for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</verse>
				<verse number="47">“No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?”</verse>
				<verse number="48">So he gave orders to have them baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him,</verse>
				<verse number="3">saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and shared a meal with them.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But Peter began and explained it to them point by point, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="5">“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">As I stared I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord, for nothing defiled or ritually unclean has ever entered my mouth!’</verse>
				<verse number="9">But the voice replied a second time from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!’</verse>
				<verse number="10">This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up to heaven again.</verse>
				<verse number="11">At that very moment, three men sent to me from Caesarea approached the house where we were staying.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He informed us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,</verse>
				<verse number="14">who will speak a message to you by which you and your entire household will be saved.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he did on us at the beginning.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, as he used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder God?”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted the repentance that leads to life even to the Gentiles.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message to no one but Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene among them who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks too, proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="22">A report about them came to the attention of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts,</verse>
				<verse number="24">because he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a significant number of people were brought to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul,</verse>
				<verse number="26">and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught a significant number of people. Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</verse>
				<verse number="27">At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="28">One of them, named Agabus, got up and predicted by the Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over the whole inhabited world. (This took place during the reign of Claudius.)</verse>
				<verse number="29">So the disciples, each in accordance with his financial ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They did so, sending their financial aid to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">About that time King Herod laid hands on some from the church to harm them.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He had James, the brother of John, executed with a sword.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter too. (This took place during the feast of Unleavened Bread.)</verse>
				<verse number="4">When he had seized him, he put him in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him. Herod planned to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So Peter was kept in prison, but those in the church were earnestly praying to God for him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">On that very night before Herod was going to bring him out for trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the prison cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The angel said to him, “Fasten your belt and put on your sandals.” Peter did so. Then the angel said to him, “Put on your cloak and follow me.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Peter went out and followed him; he did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
				<verse number="10">After they had passed the first and second guards, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went outside and walked down one narrow street, when at once the angel left him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting to happen.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When Peter realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many people had gathered together and were praying.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When he knocked at the door of the outer gate, a slave girl named Rhoda answered.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she did not open the gate, but ran back in and told them that Peter was standing at the gate.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But they said to her, “You’ve lost your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was Peter, and they kept saying, “It is his angel!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were greatly astonished.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and then related how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, “Tell James and the brothers these things,” and then he left and went to another place.</verse>
				<verse number="18">At daybreak there was great consternation among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When Herod had searched for him and did not find him, he questioned the guards and commanded that they be led away to execution. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now Herod was having an angry quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they joined together and presented themselves before him. And after convincing Blastus, the king’s personal assistant, to help them, they asked for peace, because their country’s food supply was provided by the king’s country.</verse>
				<verse number="21">On a day determined in advance, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the judgment seat, and made a speech to them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the crowd began to shout, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck Herod down because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But the word of God kept on increasing and multiplying.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had completed their mission, bringing along with them John Mark.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Now there were these prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen (a close friend of Herod the tetrarch from childhood ) and Saul.</verse>
				<verse number="2">While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then, after they had fasted and prayed and placed their hands on them, they sent them off.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So Barnabas and Saul, sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they arrived in Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. (Now they also had John as their assistant.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they had crossed over the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="7">who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The proconsul summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the magician Elymas (for that is the way his name is translated) opposed them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But Saul (also known as Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, stared straight at him</verse>
				<verse number="10">and said, “You who are full of all deceit and all wrongdoing, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness — will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time!” Immediately mistiness and darkness came over him, and he went around seeking people to lead him by the hand.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was greatly astounded at the teaching about the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Moving on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
				<verse number="15">After the reading from the law and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any message of exhortation for the people, speak it.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So Paul stood up, gestured with his hand and said, “Men of Israel, and you Gentiles who fear God, listen:</verse>
				<verse number="17">The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay as foreigners in the country of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="19">After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave his people their land as an inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="20">All this took about four hundred fifty years. After this he gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.</verse>
				<verse number="22">After removing him, God raised up David their king. He testified about him: ‘ I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after my heart, who will accomplish everything I want him to do.’</verse>
				<verse number="23">From the descendants of this man God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, just as he promised.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Before Jesus arrived, John had proclaimed a baptism for repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But while John was completing his mission, he said repeatedly, ‘What do you think I am? I am not he. But look, one is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet!’</verse>
				<verse number="26">Brothers, descendants of Abraham’s family, and those Gentiles among you who fear God, the message of this salvation has been sent to us.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize him, and they fulfilled the sayings of the prophets that are read every Sabbath by condemning him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Though they found no basis for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</verse>
				<verse number="29">When they had accomplished everything that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
				<verse number="31">and for many days he appeared to those who had accompanied him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And we proclaim to you the good news about the promise to our ancestors,</verse>
				<verse number="33">that this promise God has fulfilled to us, their children, by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second psalm, ‘ You are my Son; today I have fathered you.’</verse>
				<verse number="34">But regarding the fact that he has raised Jesus from the dead, never again to be in a state of decay, God has spoken in this way: ‘ I will give you the holy and trustworthy promises made to David.’</verse>
				<verse number="35">Therefore he also says in another psalm, ‘ You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay.’</verse>
				<verse number="36">For David, after he had served God’s purpose in his own generation, died, was buried with his ancestors, and experienced decay,</verse>
				<verse number="37">but the one whom God raised up did not experience decay.</verse>
				<verse number="38">Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</verse>
				<verse number="39">and by this one everyone who believes is justified from everything from which the law of Moses could not justify you.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Watch out, then, that what is spoken about by the prophets does not happen to you:</verse>
				<verse number="41">‘ Look, you scoffers; be amazed and perish! For I am doing a work in your days, a work you would never believe, even if someone tells you.’”</verse>
				<verse number="42">As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people were urging them to speak about these things on the next Sabbath.</verse>
				<verse number="43">When the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and were persuading them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
				<verse number="44">On the next Sabbath almost the whole city assembled together to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="45">But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they began to contradict what Paul was saying by reviling him.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Both Paul and Barnabas replied courageously, “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we are turning to the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="47">For this is what the Lord has commanded us: ‘ I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the ends of the earth. ’”</verse>
				<verse number="48">When the Gentiles heard this, they began to rejoice and praise the word of the Lord, and all who had been appointed for eternal life believed.</verse>
				<verse number="49">So the word of the Lord was spreading through the entire region.</verse>
				<verse number="50">But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high social standing and the prominent men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their region.</verse>
				<verse number="51">So after they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them, they went to Iconium.</verse>
				<verse number="52">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">The same thing happened in Iconium when Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large group of both Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So they stayed there for a considerable time, speaking out courageously for the Lord, who testified to the message of his grace, granting miraculous signs and wonders to be performed through their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But the population of the city was divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When both the Gentiles and the Jews (together with their rulers) made an attempt to mistreat them and stone them,</verse>
				<verse number="6">Paul and Barnabas learned about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding region.</verse>
				<verse number="7">There they continued to proclaim the good news.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In Lystra sat a man who could not use his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking. When Paul stared intently at him and saw he had faith to be healed,</verse>
				<verse number="10">he said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And the man leaped up and began walking.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">They began to call Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The priest of the temple of Zeus, located just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the city gates; he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,</verse>
				<verse number="15">“Men, why are you doing these things? We too are men, with human natures just like you! We are proclaiming the good news to you, so that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,</verse>
				<verse number="17">yet he did not leave himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and your hearts with joy.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Even by saying these things, they scarcely persuaded the crowds not to offer sacrifice to them.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and after winning the crowds over, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, presuming him to be dead.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But after the disciples had surrounded him, he got up and went back into the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</verse>
				<verse number="21">After they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must enter the kingdom of God through many persecutions.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">When they had appointed elders for them in the various churches, with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the protection of the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then they passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia,</verse>
				<verse number="25">and when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</verse>
				<verse number="26">From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported all the things God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So they spent considerable time with the disciples.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Now some men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">When Paul and Barnabas had a major argument and debate with them, the church appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to meet with the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this point of disagreement.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, they were relating at length the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all the things God had done with them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But some from the religious party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise the Gentiles and to order them to observe the law of Moses.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Both the apostles and the elders met together to deliberate about this matter.</verse>
				<verse number="7">After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
				<verse number="11">On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">The whole group kept quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul while they explained all the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">After they stopped speaking, James replied, “Brothers, listen to me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Simeon has explained how God first concerned himself to select from among the Gentiles a people for his name.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written,</verse>
				<verse number="16">‘ After this I will return, and I will rebuild the fallen tent of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,</verse>
				<verse number="17">so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, namely, all the Gentiles I have called to be my own, ’ says the Lord, who makes these things</verse>
				<verse number="18">known from long ago.</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Therefore I conclude that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles who are turning to God,</verse>
				<verse number="20">but that we should write them a letter telling them to abstain from things defiled by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town from ancient times, because he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to send men chosen from among them, Judas called Barsabbas and Silas, leaders among the brothers, to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They sent this letter with them: From the apostles and elders, your brothers, to the Gentile brothers and sisters in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, greetings!</verse>
				<verse number="24">Since we have heard that some have gone out from among us with no orders from us and have confused you, upsetting your minds by what they said,</verse>
				<verse number="25">we have unanimously decided to choose men to send to you along with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
				<verse number="26">who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas who will tell you these things themselves in person.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place any greater burden on you than these necessary rules:</verse>
				<verse number="29">that you abstain from meat that has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from doing these things, you will do well. Farewell.</verse>
				<verse number="30">So when they were dismissed, they went down to Antioch, and after gathering the entire group together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
				<verse number="31">When they read it aloud, the people rejoiced at its encouragement.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Both Judas and Silas, who were prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with a long speech.</verse>
				<verse number="33">After they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.</verse>
				<verse number="34">***</verse>
				<verse number="35">But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming (along with many others) the word of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="36">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord to see how they are doing.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">Barnabas wanted to bring John called Mark along with them too,</verse>
				<verse number="38">but Paul insisted that they should not take along this one who had left them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work.</verse>
				<verse number="39">They had a sharp disagreement, so that they parted company. Barnabas took along Mark and sailed away to Cyprus,</verse>
				<verse number="40">but Paul chose Silas and set out, commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">He also came to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but whose father was a Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As they went through the towns, they passed on the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the Gentile believers to obey.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number every day.</verse>
				<verse number="6">They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in the province of Asia.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When they came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to do this,</verse>
				<verse number="8">so they passed through Mysia and went down to Troas.</verse>
				<verse number="9">A vision appeared to Paul during the night: A Macedonian man was standing there urging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">After Paul saw the vision, we attempted immediately to go over to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We put out to sea from Troas and sailed a straight course to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. We stayed in this city for some days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the side of the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer, and we sat down and began to speak to the women who had assembled there.</verse>
				<verse number="14">A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, a God-fearing woman, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying.</verse>
				<verse number="15">After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, “If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she persuaded us.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who had a spirit that enabled her to foretell the future by supernatural means. She brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling.</verse>
				<verse number="17">She followed behind Paul and us and kept crying out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">She continued to do this for many days. But Paul became greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out of her at once.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But when her owners saw their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion. They are Jews</verse>
				<verse number="21">and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, since we are Romans.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The crowd joined the attack against them, and the magistrates tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After they had beaten them severely, they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to guard them securely.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Receiving such orders, he threw them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
				<verse number="25">About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the rest of the prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors flew open, and the bonds of all the prisoners came loose.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he assumed the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But Paul called out loudly, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell down trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then he brought them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</verse>
				<verse number="31">They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him, along with all those who were in his house.</verse>
				<verse number="33">At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and all his family were baptized right away.</verse>
				<verse number="34">The jailer brought them into his house and set food before them, and he rejoiced greatly that he had come to believe in God, together with his entire household.</verse>
				<verse number="35">At daybreak the magistrates sent their police officers, saying, “Release those men.”</verse>
				<verse number="36">The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So come out now and go in peace.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">But Paul said to the police officers, “They had us beaten in public without a proper trial — even though we are Roman citizens — and they threw us in prison. And now they want to send us away secretly? Absolutely not! They themselves must come and escort us out!”</verse>
				<verse number="38">The police officers reported these words to the magistrates. They were frightened when they heard Paul and Silas were Roman citizens</verse>
				<verse number="39">and came and apologized to them. After they brought them out, they asked them repeatedly to leave the city.</verse>
				<verse number="40">When they came out of the prison, they entered Lydia’s house, and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">After they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Paul went to the Jews in the synagogue, as he customarily did, and on three Sabbath days he addressed them from the scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="3">explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and to rise from the dead, saying, “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large group of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the Jews became jealous, and gathering together some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, trying to find Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, screaming, “These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here too,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and Jason has welcomed them as guests! They are all acting against Caesar’s decrees, saying there is another king named Jesus!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">They caused confusion among the crowd and the city officials who heard these things.</verse>
				<verse number="9">After the city officials had received bail from Jason and the others, they released them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The brothers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea at once, during the night. When they arrived, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="11">These Jews were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they eagerly received the message, examining the scriptures carefully every day to see if these things were so.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore many of them believed, along with quite a few prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that Paul had also proclaimed the word of God in Berea, they came there too, inciting and disturbing the crowds.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then the brothers sent Paul away to the coast at once, but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Those who accompanied Paul escorted him as far as Athens, and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
				<verse number="16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was greatly upset because he saw the city was full of idols.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So he was addressing the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles in the synagogue, and in the marketplace every day those who happened to be there.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were asking, “What does this foolish babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods.” (They said this because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.)</verse>
				<verse number="19">So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming?</verse>
				<verse number="20">For you are bringing some surprising things to our ears, so we want to know what they mean.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling or listening to something new.)</verse>
				<verse number="22">So Paul stood before the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in all respects.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For as I went around and observed closely your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an unknown god.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it, this I proclaim to you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The God who made the world and everything in it, who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands,</verse>
				<verse number="25">nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives life and breath and everything to everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="26">From one man he made every nation of the human race to inhabit the entire earth, determining their set times and the fixed limits of the places where they would live,</verse>
				<verse number="27">so that they would search for God and perhaps grope around for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For in him we live and move about and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we too are his offspring.’</verse>
				<verse number="29">So since we are God’s offspring, we should not think the deity is like gold or silver or stone, an image made by human skill and imagination.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Therefore, although God has overlooked such times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent,</verse>
				<verse number="31">because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom he designated, having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Now when they heard about the resurrection from the dead, some began to scoff, but others said, “We will hear you again about this.”</verse>
				<verse number="33">So Paul left the Areopagus.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But some people joined him and believed. Among them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">After this Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
				<verse number="2">There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome. Paul approached them,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and because he worked at the same trade, he stayed with them and worked with them (for they were tentmakers by trade).</verse>
				<verse number="4">He addressed both Jews and Greeks in the synagogue every Sabbath, attempting to persuade them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul became wholly absorbed with proclaiming the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">When they opposed him and reviled him, he protested by shaking out his clothes and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am guiltless! From now on I will go to the Gentiles!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then Paul left the synagogue and went to the house of a person named Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Crispus, the president of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household, and many of the Corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,</verse>
				<verse number="10">because I am with you, and no one will assault you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">So he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews attacked Paul together and brought him before the judgment seat,</verse>
				<verse number="13">saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of some crime or serious piece of villainy, I would have been justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews,</verse>
				<verse number="15">but since it concerns points of disagreement about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then he had them forced away from the judgment seat.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So they all seized Sosthenes, the president of the synagogue, and began to beat him in front of the judgment seat. Yet none of these things were of any concern to Gallio.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Paul, after staying many more days in Corinth, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because he had made a vow.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind there, but he himself went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they asked him to stay longer, he would not consent,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but said farewell to them and added, “I will come back to you again if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus,</verse>
				<verse number="22">and when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem and then went down to Antioch.</verse>
				<verse number="23">After he spent some time there, Paul left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker, well-versed in the scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and with great enthusiasm he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he assisted greatly those who had believed by grace,</verse>
				<verse number="28">for he refuted the Jews vigorously in public debate, demonstrating from the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples there</verse>
				<verse number="2">and said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So Paul said, “Into what then were you baptized?” “Into John’s baptism,” they replied.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and when Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</verse>
				<verse number="7">(Now there were about twelve men in all.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">So Paul entered the synagogue and spoke out fearlessly for three months, addressing and convincing them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But when some were stubborn and refused to believe, reviling the Way before the congregation, he left them and took the disciples with him, addressing them every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
				<verse number="10">This went on for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands,</verse>
				<verse number="12">so that when even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body were brought to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were possessed by evil spirits, saying, “I sternly warn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">(Now seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jewish high priest, were doing this.)</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the evil spirit replied to them, “I know about Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then the man who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them all into submission. He prevailed against them so that they fled from that house naked and wounded.</verse>
				<verse number="17">This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; fear came over them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was praised.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Many of those who had believed came forward, confessing and making their deeds known.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Large numbers of those who had practiced magic collected their books and burned them up in the presence of everyone. When the value of the books was added up, it was found to total fifty thousand silver coins.</verse>
				<verse number="20">In this way the word of the Lord continued to grow in power and to prevail.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Now after all these things had taken place, Paul resolved to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. He said, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">So after sending two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed on for a while in the province of Asia.</verse>
				<verse number="23">At that time a great disturbance took place concerning the Way.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought a great deal of business to the craftsmen.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He gathered these together, along with the workmen in similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this business.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd, not only in Ephesus but in practically all of the province of Asia, by saying that gods made by hands are not gods at all.</verse>
				<verse number="27">There is danger not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing, and she whom all the province of Asia and the world worship will suffer the loss of her greatness.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">When they heard this they became enraged and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">The city was filled with the uproar, and the crowd rushed to the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But when Paul wanted to enter the public assembly, the disciples would not let him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Even some of the provincial authorities who were his friends sent a message to him, urging him not to venture into the theater.</verse>
				<verse number="32">So then some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had met together.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Some of the crowd concluded it was about Alexander because the Jews had pushed him to the front. Alexander, gesturing with his hand, was wanting to make a defense before the public assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” for about two hours.</verse>
				<verse number="35">After the city secretary quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven?</verse>
				<verse number="36">So because these facts are indisputable, you must keep quiet and not do anything reckless.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
				<verse number="38">If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against someone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another there.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But if you want anything in addition, it will have to be settled in a legal assembly.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause we can give to explain this disorderly gathering.”</verse>
				<verse number="41">After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">After the disturbance had ended, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them and saying farewell, he left to go to Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="2">After he had gone through those regions and spoken many words of encouragement to the believers there, he came to Greece,</verse>
				<verse number="3">where he stayed for three months. Because the Jews had made a plot against him as he was intending to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, as well as Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.</verse>
				<verse number="5">These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and within five days we came to the others in Troas, where we stayed for seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul began to speak to the people, and because he intended to leave the next day, he extended his message until midnight.</verse>
				<verse number="8">(Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.)</verse>
				<verse number="9">A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul continued to speak for a long time. Fast asleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, put his arms around him, and said, “Do not be distressed, for he is still alive!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then Paul went back upstairs, and after he had broken bread and eaten, he talked with them a long time, until dawn. Then he left.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They took the boy home alive and were greatly comforted.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had arranged it this way. He himself was intending to go there by land.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene.</verse>
				<verse number="15">We set sail from there, and on the following day we arrived off Chios. The next day we approached Samos, and the day after that we arrived at Miletus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so as not to spend time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to arrive in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.</verse>
				<verse number="17">From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus, telling the elders of the church to come to him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When they arrived, he said to them, “You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I set foot in the province of Asia,</verse>
				<verse number="19">serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews.</verse>
				<verse number="20">You know that I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that would be helpful, and from teaching you publicly and from house to house,</verse>
				<verse number="21">testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem without knowing what will happen to me there,</verse>
				<verse number="23">except that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But I do not consider my life worth anything to myself, so that I may finish my task and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of God’s grace.</verse>
				<verse number="25">“And now I know that none of you among whom I went around proclaiming the kingdom will see me again.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Therefore I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of you all.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For I did not hold back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Watch out for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son.</verse>
				<verse number="29">I know that after I am gone fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Even from among your own group men will arise, teaching perversions of the truth to draw the disciples away after them.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Therefore be alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace. This message is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</verse>
				<verse number="33">I have desired no one’s silver or gold or clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="34">You yourselves know that these hands of mine provided for my needs and the needs of those who were with me.</verse>
				<verse number="35">By all these things, I have shown you that by working in this way we must help the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="36">When he had said these things, he knelt down with them all and prayed.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They all began to weep loudly, and hugged Paul and kissed him,</verse>
				<verse number="38">especially saddened by what he had said, that they were not going to see him again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea, and sailing a straight course, we came to Cos, on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went aboard, and put out to sea.</verse>
				<verse number="3">After we sighted Cyprus and left it behind on our port side, we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.</verse>
				<verse number="4">After we located the disciples, we stayed there seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">When our time was over, we left and went on our way. All of them, with their wives and children, accompanied us outside of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying,</verse>
				<verse number="6">we said farewell to one another. Then we went aboard the ship, and they returned to their own homes.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We continued the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, and when we had greeted the brothers, we stayed with them for one day.</verse>
				<verse number="8">On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">(He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.)</verse>
				<verse number="10">While we remained there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He came to us, took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it, and said, “The Holy Spirit says this: ‘This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When we heard this, both we and the local people begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Because he could not be persuaded, we said no more except, “The Lord’s will be done.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">After these days we got ready and started up to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea came along with us too, and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple from the earliest times, with whom we were to stay.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were there.</verse>
				<verse number="19">When Paul had greeted them, he began to explain in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all ardent observers of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They have been informed about you — that you teach all the Jews now living among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.</verse>
				<verse number="22">What then should we do? They will no doubt hear that you have come.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow;</verse>
				<verse number="24">take them and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in conformity with the law.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But regarding the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter, having decided that they should avoid meat that has been sacrificed to idols and blood and what has been strangled and sexual immorality.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then Paul took the men the next day, and after he had purified himself along with them, he went to the temple and gave notice of the completion of the days of purification, when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from the province of Asia who had seen him in the temple area stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,</verse>
				<verse number="28">shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this sanctuary! Furthermore he has brought Greeks into the inner courts of the temple and made this holy place ritually unclean!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him previously, and they assumed Paul had brought him into the inner temple courts.)</verse>
				<verse number="30">The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple courts, and immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
				<verse number="31">While they were trying to kill him, a report was sent up to the commanding officer of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</verse>
				<verse number="32">He immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the commanding officer and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Then the commanding officer came up and arrested him and ordered him to be tied up with two chains; he then asked who he was and what he had done.</verse>
				<verse number="34">But some in the crowd shouted one thing, and others something else, and when the commanding officer was unable to find out the truth because of the disturbance, he ordered Paul to be brought into the barracks.</verse>
				<verse number="35">When he came to the steps, Paul had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob,</verse>
				<verse number="36">for a crowd of people followed them, screaming, “Away with him!”</verse>
				<verse number="37">As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commanding officer, “May I say something to you?” The officer replied, “Do you know Greek?</verse>
				<verse number="38">Then you’re not that Egyptian who started a rebellion and led the four thousand men of the ‘Assassins’ into the wilderness some time ago?”</verse>
				<verse number="39">Paul answered, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city. Please allow me to speak to the people.”</verse>
				<verse number="40">When the commanding officer had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured to the people with his hand. When they had become silent, he addressed them in Aramaic,</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">“Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense that I now make to you.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">(When they heard that he was addressing them in Aramaic, they became even quieter.) Then Paul said,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated with strictness under Gamaliel according to the law of our ancestors, and was zealous for God just as all of you are today.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I persecuted this Way even to the point of death, tying up both men and women and putting them in prison,</verse>
				<verse number="5">as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to make arrests there and bring the prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
				<verse number="6">As I was en route and near Damascus, about noon a very bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</verse>
				<verse number="8">I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’</verse>
				<verse number="9">Those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go to Damascus; there you will be told about everything that you have been designated to do.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">Since I could not see because of the brilliance of that light, I came to Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A man named Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who live there,</verse>
				<verse number="13">came to me and stood beside me and said to me, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ And at that very moment I looked up and saw him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has already chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear a command from his mouth,</verse>
				<verse number="15">because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away, calling on his name.’</verse>
				<verse number="17">When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</verse>
				<verse number="18">and saw the Lord saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">I replied, ‘Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those in the various synagogues who believed in you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And when the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing nearby, approving, and guarding the cloaks of those who were killing him.’</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then he said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”</verse>
				<verse number="22">The crowd was listening to him until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Away with this man from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live!”</verse>
				<verse number="23">While they were screaming and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust in the air,</verse>
				<verse number="24">the commanding officer ordered Paul to be brought back into the barracks. He told them to interrogate Paul by beating him with a lash so that he could find out the reason the crowd was shouting at Paul in this way.</verse>
				<verse number="25">When they had stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing nearby, “Is it legal for you to lash a man who is a Roman citizen without a proper trial?”</verse>
				<verse number="26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the commanding officer and reported it, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">So the commanding officer came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” He replied, “Yes.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">The commanding officer answered, “I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.” “But I was even born a citizen,” Paul replied.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Then those who were about to interrogate him stayed away from him, and the commanding officer was frightened when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had had him tied up.</verse>
				<verse number="30">The next day, because the commanding officer wanted to know the true reason Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole council to assemble. He then brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="23">
				<verse number="1">Paul looked directly at the council and said, “Brothers, I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God to this day.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">At that the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit there judging me according to the law, and in violation of the law you order me to be struck?”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Those standing near him said, “Do you dare insult God’s high priest?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Paul replied, “I did not realize, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, ‘ You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then when Paul noticed that part of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, he shouted out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he said this, an argument began between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
				<verse number="8">(For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</verse>
				<verse number="9">There was a great commotion, and some experts in the law from the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the argument became so great the commanding officer feared that they would tear Paul to pieces, he ordered the detachment to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Have courage, for just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">When morning came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they had killed Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="13">There were more than forty of them who formed this conspiracy.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to partake of anything until we have killed Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So now you and the council request the commanding officer to bring him down to you, as if you were going to determine his case by conducting a more thorough inquiry. We are ready to kill him before he comes near this place.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush, he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to report to him.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So the centurion took him and brought him to the commanding officer and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">The commanding officer took him by the hand, withdrew privately, and asked, “What is it that you want to report to me?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">He replied, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as if they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So do not let them persuade you to do this, because more than forty of them are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for you to agree to their request.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then the commanding officer sent the young man away, directing him, “Tell no one that you have reported these things to me.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen by nine o’clock tonight,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and provide mounts for Paul to ride so that he may be brought safely to Felix the governor.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">He wrote a letter that went like this:</verse>
				<verse number="26">***</verse>
				<verse number="27">***</verse>
				<verse number="28">***</verse>
				<verse number="29">***</verse>
				<verse number="30">***</verse>
				<verse number="31">So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night.</verse>
				<verse number="32">The next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and they returned to the barracks.</verse>
				<verse number="33">When the horsemen came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When the governor had read the letter, he asked what province he was from. When he learned that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
				<verse number="35">he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive too.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="24">
				<verse number="1">After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought formal charges against Paul to the governor.</verse>
				<verse number="2">When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We have experienced a lengthy time of peace through your rule, and reforms are being made in this nation through your foresight.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this everywhere and in every way with all gratitude.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But so that I may not delay you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For we have found this man to be a troublemaker, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we arrested him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">***</verse>
				<verse number="8">When you examine him yourself, you will be able to learn from him about all these things we are accusing him of doing.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Jews also joined in the verbal attack, claiming that these things were true.</verse>
				<verse number="10">When the governor gestured for him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I confidently make my defense.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As you can verify for yourself, not more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They did not find me arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd in the temple courts or in the synagogues or throughout the city,</verse>
				<verse number="13">nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of doing.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But I confess this to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way (which they call a sect), believing everything that is according to the law and that is written in the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I have a hope in God (a hope that these men themselves accept too) that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
				<verse number="16">This is the reason I do my best to always have a clear conscience toward God and toward people.</verse>
				<verse number="17">After several years I came to bring to my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings,</verse>
				<verse number="18">which I was doing when they found me in the temple, ritually purified, without a crowd or a disturbance.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who should be here before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Or these men here should tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the council,</verse>
				<verse number="21">other than this one thing I shouted out while I stood before them: ‘I am on trial before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead.’”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Then Felix, who understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately, adjourned their hearing, saying, “When Lysias the commanding officer comes down, I will decide your case.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">He ordered the centurion to guard Paul, but to let him have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from meeting his needs.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Some days later, when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="25">While Paul was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will send for you.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money, and for this reason he sent for Paul as often as possible and talked with him.</verse>
				<verse number="27">After two years had passed, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix, and because he wanted to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="25">
				<verse number="1">Now three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought formal charges against Paul to him.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Requesting him to do them a favor against Paul, they urged Festus to summon him to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him along the way.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself intended to go there shortly.</verse>
				<verse number="5">“So,” he said, “let your leaders go down there with me, and if this man has done anything wrong, they may bring charges against him.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">After Festus had stayed not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges that they were not able to prove.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Paul said in his defense, “I have committed no offense against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried before me there on these charges?”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If then I am in the wrong and have done anything that deserves death, I am not trying to escape dying, but if not one of their charges against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then, after conferring with his council, Festus replied, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you will go!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">While they were staying there many days, Festus explained Paul’s case to the king to get his opinion, saying, “There is a man left here as a prisoner by Felix.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met his accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the accusation.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So after they came back here with me, I did not postpone the case, but the next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the evil deeds I had suspected.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Rather they had several points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Because I was at a loss how I could investigate these matters, I asked if he were willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will hear him.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience hall, along with the senior military officers and the prominent men of the city. When Festus gave the order, Paul was brought in.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all you who are present here with us, you see this man about whom the entire Jewish populace petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting loudly that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But I found that he had done nothing that deserved death, and when he appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this preliminary hearing I may have something to write.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="26">
				<verse number="1">So Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul held out his hand and began his defense:</verse>
				<verse number="2">“Regarding all the things I have been accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today,</verse>
				<verse number="3">because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversial issues of the Jews. Therefore I ask you to listen to me patiently.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now all the Jews know the way I lived from my youth, spending my life from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They know, because they have known me from time past, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors,</verse>
				<verse number="7">a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews are accusing me, Your Majesty!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Why do you people think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Of course, I myself was convinced that it was necessary to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And that is what I did in Jerusalem: Not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons by the authority I received from the chief priests, but I also cast my vote against them when they were sentenced to death.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. Because I was so furiously enraged at them, I went to persecute them even in foreign cities.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“While doing this very thing, as I was going to Damascus with authority and complete power from the chief priests,</verse>
				<verse number="13">about noon along the road, Your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining everywhere around me and those traveling with me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are hurting yourself by kicking against the goads.’</verse>
				<verse number="15">So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this reason, to designate you in advance as a servant and witness to the things you have seen and to the things in which I will appear to you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you</verse>
				<verse number="18">to open their eyes so that they turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</verse>
				<verse number="19">“Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
				<verse number="20">but I declared to those in Damascus first, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts and were trying to kill me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I have experienced help from God to this day, and so I stand testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said was going to happen:</verse>
				<verse number="23">that the Christ was to suffer and be the first to rise from the dead, to proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">As Paul was saying these things in his defense, Festus exclaimed loudly, “You have lost your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!”</verse>
				<verse number="25">But Paul replied, “I have not lost my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking true and rational words.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For the king knows about these things, and I am speaking freely to him, because I cannot believe that any of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">Agrippa said to Paul, “In such a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Paul replied, “I pray to God that whether in a short or a long time not only you but also all those who are listening to me today could become such as I am, except for these chains.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">So the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them,</verse>
				<verse number="31">and as they were leaving they said to one another, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="27">
				<verse number="1">When it was decided we would sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We went on board a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to various ports along the coast of the province of Asia and put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends so they could provide him with what he needed.</verse>
				<verse number="4">From there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</verse>
				<verse number="5">After we had sailed across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia.</verse>
				<verse number="6">There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind prevented us from going any farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.</verse>
				<verse number="8">With difficulty we sailed along the coast of Crete and came to a place called Fair Havens that was near the town of Lasea.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast was already over, Paul advised them,</verse>
				<verse number="10">“Men, I can see the voyage is going to end in disaster and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the centurion was more convinced by the captain and the ship’s owner than by what Paul said.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there. They hoped that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they could carry out their purpose, so they weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Not long after this, a hurricane-force wind called the northeaster blew down from the island.</verse>
				<verse number="15">When the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.</verse>
				<verse number="16">As we ran under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control.</verse>
				<verse number="17">After the crew had hoisted it aboard, they used supports to undergird the ship. Fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor, thus letting themselves be driven along.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The next day, because we were violently battered by the storm, they began throwing the cargo overboard,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands.</verse>
				<verse number="20">When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm continued to batter us, we finally abandoned all hope of being saved.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Since many of them had no desire to eat, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not put out to sea from Crete, thus avoiding this damage and loss.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And now I advise you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only the ship will be lost.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve came to me</verse>
				<verse number="24">and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! You must stand before Caesar, and God has graciously granted you the safety of all who are sailing with you.’</verse>
				<verse number="25">Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be just as I have been told.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But we must run aground on some island.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">When the fourteenth night had come, while we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected they were approaching some land.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep; when they had sailed a little farther they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Because they were afraid that we would run aground on the rocky coast, they threw out four anchors from the stern and wished for day to appear.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow,</verse>
				<verse number="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
				<verse number="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it drift away.</verse>
				<verse number="33">As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense and have gone without food; you have eaten nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is important for your survival. For not one of you will lose a hair from his head.”</verse>
				<verse number="35">After he said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="36">So all of them were encouraged and took food themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="37">(We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons on the ship.)</verse>
				<verse number="38">When they had eaten enough to be satisfied, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="39">When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.</verse>
				<verse number="40">So they slipped the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the linkage that bound the steering oars together. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and steered toward the beach.</verse>
				<verse number="41">But they encountered a patch of crosscurrents and ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and could not be moved, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them would escape by swimming away.</verse>
				<verse number="43">But the centurion, wanting to save Paul’s life, prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,</verse>
				<verse number="44">and the rest were to follow, some on planks and some on pieces of the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to land.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="28">
				<verse number="1">After we had safely reached shore, we learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
				<verse number="2">The local inhabitants showed us extraordinary kindness, for they built a fire and welcomed us all because it had started to rain and was cold.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When the local people saw the creature hanging from Paul’s hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer! Although he has escaped from the sea, Justice herself has not allowed him to live!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly drop dead. So after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now in the region around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably as guests for three days.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The father of Publius lay sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and after praying, placed his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">After this had happened, many of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They also bestowed many honors, and when we were preparing to sail, they gave us all the supplies we needed.</verse>
				<verse number="11">After three months we put out to sea in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island and had the “Heavenly Twins” as its figurehead.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.</verse>
				<verse number="13">From there we cast off and arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli.</verse>
				<verse number="14">There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The brothers from there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When he saw them, Paul thanked God and took courage.</verse>
				<verse number="16">When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">After three days Paul called the local Jewish leaders together. When they had assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, from Jerusalem I was handed over as a prisoner to the Romans.</verse>
				<verse number="18">When they had heard my case, they wanted to release me, because there was no basis for a death sentence against me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar — not that I had some charge to bring against my own people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">So for this reason I have asked to see you and speak with you, for I am bound with this chain because of the hope of Israel.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">They replied, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, nor have any of the brothers come from there and reported or said anything bad about you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But we would like to hear from you what you think, for regarding this sect we know that people everywhere speak against it.”</verse>
				<verse number="23">They set a day to meet with him, and they came to him where he was staying in even greater numbers. From morning until evening he explained things to them, testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Some were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So they began to leave, unable to agree among themselves, after Paul made one last statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah</verse>
				<verse number="26">when he said, ‘ Go to this people and say, “ You will keep on hearing, but will never understand, and you will keep on looking, but will never perceive.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For the heart of this people has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.”’</verse>
				<verse number="28">“Therefore be advised that this salvation from God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen!”</verse>
				<verse number="29">***</verse>
				<verse number="30">Paul lived there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him,</verse>
				<verse number="31">proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with complete boldness and without restriction.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="45">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">This gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="3">concerning his Son who was a descendant of David with reference to the flesh,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power according to the Holy Spirit by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Through him we have received grace and our apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of his name.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You also are among them, called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">To all those loved by God in Rome, called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="8">First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness that I continually remember you</verse>
				<verse number="10">and I always ask in my prayers, if perhaps now at last I may succeed in visiting you according to the will of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,</verse>
				<verse number="12">that is, that we may be mutually comforted by one another’s faith, both yours and mine.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I often intended to come to you (and was prevented until now), so that I may have some fruit even among you, just as I already have among the rest of the Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Thus I am eager also to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel from faith to faith, just as it is written, “ The righteous by faith will live.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="19">because what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes — his eternal power and divine nature — have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give him thanks, but they became futile in their thoughts and their senseless hearts were darkened.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</verse>
				<verse number="23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image resembling mortal human beings or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="25">They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged the natural sexual relations for unnatural ones,</verse>
				<verse number="27">and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed in their passions for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what should not be done.</verse>
				<verse number="29">They are filled with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice. They are rife with envy, murder, strife, deceit, hostility. They are gossips,</verse>
				<verse number="30">slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, contrivers of all sorts of evil, disobedient to parents,</verse>
				<verse number="31">senseless, covenant-breakers, heartless, ruthless.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Although they fully know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but also approve of those who practice them.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Therefore you are without excuse, whoever you are, when you judge someone else. For on whatever grounds you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge practice the same things.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now we know that God’s judgment is in accordance with truth against those who practice such things.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And do you think, whoever you are, when you judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape God’s judgment?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Or do you have contempt for the wealth of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, and yet do not know that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?</verse>
				<verse number="5">But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourselves in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed!</verse>
				<verse number="6">He will reward each one according to his works:</verse>
				<verse number="7">eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory and honor and immortality,</verse>
				<verse number="8">but wrath and anger to those who live in selfish ambition and do not obey the truth but follow unrighteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">There will be affliction and distress on everyone who does evil, on the Jew first and also the Greek,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, for the Jew first and also the Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous before God, but those who do the law will be declared righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="15">They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them,</verse>
				<verse number="16">on the day when God will judge the secrets of human hearts, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relationship to God</verse>
				<verse number="18">and know his will and approve the superior things because you receive instruction from the law,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
				<verse number="20">an educator of the senseless, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the essential features of knowledge and of the truth —</verse>
				<verse number="21">therefore you who teach someone else, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse>
				<verse number="22">You who tell others not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
				<verse number="23">You who boast in the law dishonor God by transgressing the law!</verse>
				<verse number="24">For just as it is written, “ the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">For circumcision has its value if you practice the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse>
				<verse number="27">And will not the physically uncircumcised man who keeps the law judge you who, despite the written code and circumcision, transgress the law?</verse>
				<verse number="28">For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh,</verse>
				<verse number="29">but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart by the Spirit and not by the written code. This person’s praise is not from people but from God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Therefore what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the value of circumcision?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Actually, there are many advantages. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">What then? If some did not believe, does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Absolutely not! Let God be proven true, and every human being shown up as a liar, just as it is written: “ so that you will be justified in your words and will prevail when you are judged.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is he? (I am speaking in human terms.)</verse>
				<verse number="6">Absolutely not! For otherwise how could God judge the world?</verse>
				<verse number="7">For if by my lie the truth of God enhances his glory, why am I still actually being judged as a sinner?</verse>
				<verse number="8">And why not say, “Let us do evil so that good may come of it”? — as some who slander us allege that we say. (Their condemnation is deserved!)</verse>
				<verse number="9">What then? Are we better off? Certainly not, for we have already charged that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin,</verse>
				<verse number="10">just as it is written: “ There is no one righteous, not even one,</verse>
				<verse number="11">there is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">All have turned away, together they have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, not even one. ”</verse>
				<verse number="13">“ Their throats are open graves, they deceive with their tongues, the poison of asps is under their lips.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">“ Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">“ Their feet are swift to shed blood,</verse>
				<verse number="16">ruin and misery are in their paths,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and the way of peace they have not known.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">“ There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For no one is declared righteous before him by the works of the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But now apart from the law the righteousness of God (which is attested by the law and the prophets) has been disclosed —</verse>
				<verse number="22">namely, the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,</verse>
				<verse number="23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="25">God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat accessible through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because God in his forbearance had passed over the sins previously committed.</verse>
				<verse number="26">This was also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time, so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus’ faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded! By what principle? Of works? No, but by the principle of faith!</verse>
				<verse number="28">For we consider that a person is declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles too? Yes, of the Gentiles too!</verse>
				<verse number="30">Since God is one, he will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! Instead we uphold the law.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has discovered regarding this matter?</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if Abraham was declared righteous by the works of the law, he has something to boast about — but not before God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For what does the scripture say? “ Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited due to grace but due to obligation.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous, his faith is credited as righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So even David himself speaks regarding the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</verse>
				<verse number="8">blessed is the one against whom the Lord will never count sin.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Is this blessedness then for the circumcision or also for the uncircumcision? For we say, “ faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">How then was it credited to him? Was he circumcised at the time, or not? No, he was not circumcised but uncircumcised!</verse>
				<verse number="11">And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, so that he would become the father of all those who believe but have never been circumcised, that they too could have righteousness credited to them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And he is also the father of the circumcised, who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham possessed when he was still uncircumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not fulfilled through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if they become heirs by the law, faith is empty and the promise is nullified.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression either.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace, with the result that the promise may be certain to all the descendants — not only to those who are under the law, but also to those who have the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</verse>
				<verse number="17">(as it is written, “ I have made you the father of many nations ”). He is our father in the presence of God whom he believed — the God who makes the dead alive and summons the things that do not yet exist as though they already do.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Against hope Abraham believed in hope with the result that he became the father of many nations according to the pronouncement, “ so will your descendants be.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Without being weak in faith, he considered his own body as dead (because he was about one hundred years old) and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He did not waver in unbelief about the promise of God but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">He was fully convinced that what God promised he was also able to do.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So indeed it was credited to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But the statement it was credited to him was not written only for Abraham’s sake,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited, those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He was given over because of our transgressions and was raised for the sake of our justification.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="2">through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of God’s glory.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Not only this, but we also rejoice in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and endurance, character, and character, hope.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">(For rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person perhaps someone might possibly dare to die.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous by his blood, we will be saved through him from God’s wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life?</verse>
				<verse number="11">Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all people because all sinned —</verse>
				<verse number="13">for before the law was given, sin was in the world, but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type of the coming one) transgressed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But the gracious gift is not like the transgression. For if the many died through the transgression of the one man, how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ multiply to the many!</verse>
				<verse number="16">And the gift is not like the one who sinned. For judgment, resulting from the one transgression, led to condemnation, but the gracious gift from the many failures led to justification.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For if, by the transgression of the one man, death reigned through the one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Consequently, just as condemnation for all people came through one transgression, so too through the one righteous act came righteousness leading to life for all people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now the law came in so that the transgression may increase, but where sin increased, grace multiplied all the more,</verse>
				<verse number="21">so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We know that our old man was crucified with him so that the body of sin would no longer dominate us, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</verse>
				<verse number="7">(For someone who has died has been freed from sin.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he is never going to die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the death he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So you too consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For sin will have no mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Do you not know that if you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in righteousness?</verse>
				<verse number="17">But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="19">(I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So what benefit did you then reap from those things that you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But now, freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your benefit leading to sanctification, and the end is eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For the payoff of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Or do you not know, brothers and sisters (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is lord over a person as long as he lives?</verse>
				<verse number="2">For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she is joined to another man, she is not an adulteress.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you could be joined to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, to bear fruit to God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For when we were in the flesh, the sinful desires, aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code.</verse>
				<verse number="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! Certainly, I would not have known sin except through the law. For indeed I would not have known what it means to desire something belonging to someone else if the law had not said, “ Do not covet.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And I was once alive apart from the law, but with the coming of the commandment sin became alive</verse>
				<verse number="10">and I died. So I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death!</verse>
				<verse number="11">For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it I died.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, so that it would be shown to be sin, produced death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we know that the law is spiritual — but I am unspiritual, sold into slavery to sin.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For I don’t understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want — instead, I do what I hate.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if I do what I don’t want, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</verse>
				<verse number="25">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For God achieved what the law could not do because it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
				<verse number="4">so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace,</verse>
				<verse number="7">because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person does not belong to him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is your life because of righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Moreover if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit who lives in you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, brothers and sisters, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh</verse>
				<verse number="13">(for if you live according to the flesh, you will die), but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God’s children.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ) — if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared to the glory that will be revealed to us.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the creation eagerly waits for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the creation was subjected to futility — not willingly but because of God who subjected it — in hope</verse>
				<verse number="21">that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Not only this, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?</verse>
				<verse number="25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="26">In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes on behalf of the saints according to God’s will.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose,</verse>
				<verse number="29">because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.</verse>
				<verse number="31">What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
				<verse number="32">Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all — how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things?</verse>
				<verse number="33">Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
				<verse number="34">Who is the one who will condemn? Christ is the one who died (and more than that, he was raised), who is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us.</verse>
				<verse number="35">Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse>
				<verse number="36">As it is written, “ For your sake we encounter death all day long; we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”</verse>
				<verse number="37">No, in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us!</verse>
				<verse number="38">For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor heavenly rulers, nor things that are present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
				<verse number="39">nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit —</verse>
				<verse number="2">I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I could wish that I myself were accursed — cut off from Christ — for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.</verse>
				<verse number="5">To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, by human descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="7">nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants; rather “ through Isaac will your descendants be counted.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this is what the promise declared: “ About a year from now I will return and Sarah will have a son.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac —</verse>
				<verse number="11">even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling) —</verse>
				<verse number="12">it was said to her, “ The older will serve the younger,”</verse>
				<verse number="13">just as it is written: “ Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!</verse>
				<verse number="15">For he says to Moses: “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh: “ For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?”</verse>
				<verse number="20">But who indeed are you — a mere human being — to talk back to God? Does what is molded say to the molder, “ Why have you made me like this? ”</verse>
				<verse number="21">Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use?</verse>
				<verse number="22">But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction?</verse>
				<verse number="23">And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory —</verse>
				<verse number="24">even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</verse>
				<verse number="25">As he also says in Hosea: “ I will call those who were not my people, ‘ My people,’ and I will call her who was unloved, ‘ My beloved.’”</verse>
				<verse number="26">“ And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘ You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘ sons of the living God.’”</verse>
				<verse number="27">And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, “ Though the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved,</verse>
				<verse number="28">for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly.”</verse>
				<verse number="29">Just as Isaiah predicted, “ If the Lord of armies had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have resembled Gomorrah.”</verse>
				<verse number="30">What shall we say then? — that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith,</verse>
				<verse number="31">but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,</verse>
				<verse number="33">just as it is written, “ Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble and a rock that will make them fall, yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame. ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I can testify that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not in line with the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “ The one who does these things will live by them.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the righteousness that is by faith says: “ Do not say in your heart, ‘ Who will ascend into heaven? ’” (that is, to bring Christ down)</verse>
				<verse number="7">or “ Who will descend into the abyss? ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</verse>
				<verse number="8">But what does it say? “ The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart ” (that is, the word of faith that we preach),</verse>
				<verse number="9">because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the scripture says, “ Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="14">How are they to call on one they have not believed in? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them?</verse>
				<verse number="15">And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “ How timely is the arrival of those who proclaim the good news.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “ Lord, who has believed our report?”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have: Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But again I ask, didn’t Israel understand? First Moses says, “ I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, “ I was found by those who did not seek me; I became well known to those who did not ask for me.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">But about Israel he says, “ All day long I held out my hands to this disobedient and stubborn people! ”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
				<verse number="2">God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life! ”</verse>
				<verse number="4">But what was the divine response to him? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
				<verse number="7">What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The rest were hardened,</verse>
				<verse number="8">as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, to this very day.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And David says, “Let their table become a snare and trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</verse>
				<verse number="10">let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and make their backs bend continually.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration bring?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,</verse>
				<verse number="14">if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="16">If the first portion of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root,</verse>
				<verse number="18">do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then you will say, “The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Granted! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear!</verse>
				<verse number="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God — harshness toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And even they — if they do not continue in their unbelief — will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?</verse>
				<verse number="25">For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come out of Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And this is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience,</verse>
				<verse number="31">so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="32">For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how fathomless his ways!</verse>
				<verse number="34">For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?</verse>
				<verse number="35">Or who has first given to God, that God needs to repay him?</verse>
				<verse number="36">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice — alive, holy, and pleasing to God — which is your reasonable service.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Do not be conformed to this present world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may test and approve what is the will of God — what is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober discernment, as God has distributed to each of you a measure of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For just as in one body we have many members, and not all the members serve the same function,</verse>
				<verse number="5">so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually we are members who belong to one another.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And we have different gifts according to the grace given to us. If the gift is prophecy, that individual must use it in proportion to his faith.</verse>
				<verse number="7">If it is service, he must serve; if it is teaching, he must teach;</verse>
				<verse number="8">if it is exhortation, he must exhort; if it is contributing, he must do so with sincerity; if it is leadership, he must do so with diligence; if it is showing mercy, he must do so with cheerfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Be devoted to one another with mutual love, showing eagerness in honoring one another.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do not lag in zeal, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Rejoice in hope, endure in suffering, persist in prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Contribute to the needs of the saints, pursue hospitality.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Do not repay anyone evil for evil; consider what is good before all people.</verse>
				<verse number="18">If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Do not avenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God’s wrath, for it is written, “ Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Rather, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God’s appointment, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the person who resists such authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will incur judgment</verse>
				<verse number="3">(for rulers cause no fear for good conduct but for bad). Do you desire not to fear authority? Do good and you will receive its commendation,</verse>
				<verse number="4">for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be in fear, for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God’s servant to administer retribution on the wrongdoer.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath of the authorities but also because of your conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For this reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants devoted to governing.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Pay everyone what is owed: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Owe no one anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For the commandments, “ Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,” (and if there is any other commandment) are summed up in this, “ Love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And do this because we know the time, that it is already the hour for us to awake from sleep, for our salvation is now nearer than when we became believers.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The night has advanced toward dawn; the day is near. So then we must lay aside the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Let us live decently as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in discord and jealousy.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Now receive the one who is weak in the faith, and do not have disputes over differing opinions.</verse>
				<verse number="2">One person believes in eating everything, but the weak person eats only vegetables.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The one who eats everything must not despise the one who does not, and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats everything, for God has accepted him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who are you to pass judgment on another’s servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</verse>
				<verse number="5">One person regards one day holier than other days, and another regards them all alike. Each must be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The one who observes the day does it for the Lord. The one who eats, eats for the Lord because he gives thanks to God, and the one who abstains from eating abstains for the Lord, and he gives thanks to God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If we live, we live for the Lord; if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he may be the Lord of both the dead and the living.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But you who eat vegetables only — why do you judge your brother or sister? And you who eat everything — why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For it is written, “ As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore we must not pass judgment on one another, but rather determine never to place an obstacle or a trap before a brother or sister.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself; still, it is unclean to the one who considers it unclean.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For if your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy by your food someone for whom Christ died.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore do not let what you consider good be spoken of as evil.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the kingdom of God does not consist of food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So then, let us pursue what makes for peace and for building up one another.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. For although all things are clean, it is wrong to cause anyone to stumble by what you eat.</verse>
				<verse number="21">It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that causes your brother to stumble.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The faith you have, keep to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself by what he approves.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But the man who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and whatever is not from faith is sin.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">But we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not just please ourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, “ The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now may the God of endurance and comfort give you unity with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="6">so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Receive one another, then, just as Christ also received you, to God’s glory.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth to confirm the promises made to the fathers,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and thus the Gentiles glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, “ Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles, and I will sing praises to your name.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">And again it says: “ Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And again, “ Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">And again Isaiah says, “ The root of Jesse will come, and the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles, in him will the Gentiles hope.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in him, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But I myself am fully convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But I have written more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you, because of the grace given to me by God</verse>
				<verse number="16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I serve the gospel of God like a priest, so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So I boast in Christ Jesus about the things that pertain to God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in order to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</verse>
				<verse number="19">in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And in this way I desire to preach where Christ has not been named, so as not to build on another person’s foundation,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but as it is written: “ Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">This is the reason I was often hindered from coming to you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But now there is nothing more to keep me in these regions, and I have for many years desired to come to you</verse>
				<verse number="24">when I go to Spain. For I hope to visit you when I pass through and that you will help me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For Macedonia and Achaia are pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For they were pleased to do this, and indeed they are indebted to the Jerusalem saints. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Therefore after I have completed this and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set out for Spain by way of you,</verse>
				<verse number="29">and I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of Christ’s blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to join fervently with me in prayer to God on my behalf.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Pray that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea and that my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
				<verse number="32">so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.</verse>

			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,</verse>
				<verse number="2">so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and provide her with whatever help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many, including me.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who risked their own necks for my life. Not only I, but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Also greet the church in their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Greet Andronicus and Junia, my compatriots and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my good friend Stachys.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Greet Herodion, my compatriot. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, laborers in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother who was also a mother to me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters with them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the believers who are with them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create dissensions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them!</verse>
				<verse number="18">For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of the naive.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your obedience is known to all and thus I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my compatriots.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I, Tertius, who am writing this letter, greet you in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus the city treasurer and our brother Quartus greet you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">***</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that had been kept secret for long ages,</verse>
				<verse number="26">but now is disclosed, and through the prophetic scriptures has been made known to all the nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith —</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="4">I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you were made rich in every way in him, in all your speech and in every kind of knowledge —</verse>
				<verse number="6">just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you —</verse>
				<verse number="7">so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="9">God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree together, to end your divisions, and to be united by the same mind and purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For members of Chloe’s household have made it clear to me, my brothers and sisters, that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now I mean this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Cephas,” or “I am with Christ.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Is Christ divided? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he? Or were you in fact baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
				<verse number="14">I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name!</verse>
				<verse number="16">(I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Otherwise, I do not remember whether I baptized anyone else.)</verse>
				<verse number="17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel — and not with clever speech, so that the cross of Christ would not become useless.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For it is written, “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will thwart the cleverness of the intelligent.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish?</verse>
				<verse number="21">For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom,</verse>
				<verse number="23">but we preach about a crucified Christ, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Think about the circumstances of your call, brothers and sisters. Not many were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were born to a privileged position.</verse>
				<verse number="27">But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise, and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong.</verse>
				<verse number="28">God chose what is low and despised in the world, what is regarded as nothing, to set aside what is regarded as something,</verse>
				<verse number="29">so that no one can boast in his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="30">He is the reason you have a relationship with Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
				<verse number="31">so that, as it is written, “ Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with superior eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed the testimony of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I decided to be concerned about nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling.</verse>
				<verse number="4">My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
				<verse number="5">so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Instead we speak the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery, that God determined before the ages for our glory.</verse>
				<verse number="8">None of the rulers of this age understood it. If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But just as it is written, “ Things that no eye has seen, or ear heard, or mind imagined, are the things God has prepared for those who love him.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">God has revealed these to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So too, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And we speak about these things, not with words taught us by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The unbeliever does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. And he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The one who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is understood by no one.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to advise him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">So, brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready. In fact, you are still not ready,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for you are still influenced by the flesh. For since there is still jealousy and dissension among you, are you not influenced by the flesh and behaving like unregenerate people?</verse>
				<verse number="4">For whenever someone says, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?</verse>
				<verse number="5">What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused it to grow.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So neither the one who plants counts for anything, nor the one who waters, but God who causes the growth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The one who plants and the one who waters work as one, but each will receive his reward according to his work.</verse>
				<verse number="9">We are coworkers belonging to God. You are God’s field, God’s building.</verse>
				<verse number="10">According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation, but someone else builds on it. And each one must be careful how he builds.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,</verse>
				<verse number="13">each builder’s work will be plainly seen, for the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire. And the fire will test what kind of work each has done.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?</verse>
				<verse number="17">If someone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, which is what you are.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Guard against self-deception, each of you. If someone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become foolish so that he can become wise.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. As it is written, “ He catches the wise in their craftiness.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">And again, “ The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">So then, no more boasting about mere mortals! For everything belongs to you,</verse>
				<verse number="22">whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">One should think about us this way — as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts. Then each will receive recognition from God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters, so that through us you may learn “not to go beyond what is written,” so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For who concedes you any superiority? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you did not?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you!</verse>
				<verse number="9">For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, we are dishonored!</verse>
				<verse number="11">To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and without a roof over our heads.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We do hard work, toiling with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure,</verse>
				<verse number="13">when people lie about us, we answer in a friendly manner. We are the world’s dirt and scum, even now.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I am not writing these things to shame you, but to correct you as my dear children.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I encourage you, then, be imitators of me.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people, but also their power.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power.</verse>
				<verse number="21">What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with his father’s wife.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And you are proud! Shouldn’t you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this from among you?</verse>
				<verse number="3">For even though I am absent physically, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were present.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="5">turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough — you are, in fact, without yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</verse>
				<verse number="10">In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters, since you would then have to go out of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian who is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Are you not to judge those inside?</verse>
				<verse number="13">But God will judge those outside. Remove the evil person from among you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">When any of you has a legal dispute with another, does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints?</verse>
				<verse number="2">Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to settle trivial suits?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Do you not know that we will judge angels? Why not ordinary matters!</verse>
				<verse number="4">So if you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church?</verse>
				<verse number="5">I say this to your shame! Is there no one among you wise enough to settle disputes between fellow Christians?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Instead, does a Christian sue a Christian, and do this before unbelievers?</verse>
				<verse number="7">The fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves demonstrates that you have already been defeated. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</verse>
				<verse number="8">But you yourselves wrong and cheat, and you do this to your brothers and sisters!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, passive homosexual partners, practicing homosexuals,</verse>
				<verse number="10">thieves, the greedy, drunkards, the verbally abusive, and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Some of you once lived this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“All things are lawful for me” — but not everything is beneficial. “All things are lawful for me” — but I will not be controlled by anything.</verse>
				<verse number="13">“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both.” The body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now God indeed raised the Lord and he will raise us by his power.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</verse>
				<verse number="16">Or do you not know that anyone who is united with a prostitute is one body with her? For it is said, “ The two will become one flesh.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the one united with the Lord is one spirit with him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin a person commits is outside of the body” — but the immoral person sins against his own body.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</verse>
				<verse number="20">For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now with regard to the issues you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">But because of immoralities, each man should have relations with his own wife and each woman with her own husband.</verse>
				<verse number="3">A husband should give to his wife her sexual rights, and likewise a wife to her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It is not the wife who has the rights to her own body, but the husband. In the same way, it is not the husband who has the rights to his own body, but the wife.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Do not deprive each other, except by mutual agreement for a specified time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then resume your relationship, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I say this as a concession, not as a command.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I wish that everyone was as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, another that.</verse>
				<verse number="8">To the unmarried and widows I say that it is best for them to remain as I am.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if they do not have self-control, let them get married. For it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.</verse>
				<verse number="10">To the married I give this command — not I, but the Lord — a wife should not divorce a husband</verse>
				<verse number="11">(but if she does, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband should not divorce his wife.</verse>
				<verse number="12">To the rest I say — I, not the Lord — if a brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is happy to live with him, he should not divorce her.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is happy to live with her, she should not divorce him.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified because of the wife, and the unbelieving wife because of her husband. Otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But if the unbeliever wants a divorce, let it take place. In these circumstances the brother or sister is not bound. God has called you in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For how do you know, wife, whether you will bring your husband to salvation? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will bring your wife to salvation?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Nevertheless, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each person, so must he live. I give this sort of direction in all the churches.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Was anyone called after he had been circumcised? He should not try to undo his circumcision. Was anyone called who is uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Instead, keeping God’s commandments is what counts.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Let each one remain in that situation in life in which he was called.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Were you called as a slave? Do not worry about it. But if indeed you are able to be free, make the most of the opportunity.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. In the same way, the one who was called as a free person is Christ’s slave.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men.</verse>
				<verse number="24">In whatever situation someone was called, brothers and sisters, let him remain in it with God.</verse>
				<verse number="25">With regard to the question about people who have never married, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Because of the impending crisis I think it best for you to remain as you are.</verse>
				<verse number="27">The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce. The one released from a wife should not seek marriage.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face difficult circumstances, and I am trying to spare you such problems.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And I say this, brothers and sisters: The time is short. So then those who have wives should be as those who have none,</verse>
				<verse number="30">those with tears like those not weeping, those who rejoice like those not rejoicing, those who buy like those without possessions,</verse>
				<verse number="31">those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full. For the present shape of this world is passing away.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And I want you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="33">But a married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife,</verse>
				<verse number="34">and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="35">I am saying this for your benefit, not to place a limitation on you, but so that without distraction you may give notable and constant service to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="36">If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the bloom of youth and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry.</verse>
				<verse number="37">But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his own virgin, does well.</verse>
				<verse number="38">So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, but the one who does not, does better.</verse>
				<verse number="39">A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes (only someone in the Lord).</verse>
				<verse number="40">But in my opinion, she will be happier if she remains as she is — and I think that I too have the Spirit of God!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">With regard to food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
				<verse number="2">If someone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know to the degree that he needs to know.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But if someone loves God, he is known by God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol in this world is nothing,” and that “there is no God but one.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">If after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),</verse>
				<verse number="6">yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But this knowledge is not shared by all. And some, by being accustomed to idols in former times, eat this food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now food will not bring us close to God. We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For if someone weak sees you who possess knowledge dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience be “strengthened” to eat food offered to idols?</verse>
				<verse number="11">So by your knowledge the weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If you sin against your brothers or sisters in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause one of them to sin.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?</verse>
				<verse number="2">If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the confirming sign of my apostleship in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="3">This is my defense to those who examine me.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Do we not have the right to financial support?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense, or does the law not say this as well?</verse>
				<verse number="9">For it is written in the law of Moses, “ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not concerned here about oxen, is he?</verse>
				<verse number="10">Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you?</verse>
				<verse number="12">If others receive this right from you, are we not more deserving? But we have not made use of this right. Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple eat food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings?</verse>
				<verse number="14">In the same way the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me. In fact, it would be better for me to die than — no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting!</verse>
				<verse number="16">For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!</verse>
				<verse number="17">For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward. But if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a responsibility.</verse>
				<verse number="18">What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may offer the gospel free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all, in order to gain even more people.</verse>
				<verse number="20">To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) to gain those under the law.</verse>
				<verse number="21">To those free from the law I became like one free from the law (though I am not free from God’s law but under the law of Christ) to gain those free from the law.</verse>
				<verse number="22">To the weak I became weak in order to gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I may save some.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I do all these things because of the gospel, so that I can be a participant in it.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Do you not know that all the runners in a stadium compete, but only one receives the prize? So run to win.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Each competitor must exercise self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.</verse>
				<verse number="26">So I do not run uncertainly or box like one who hits only air.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave, so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and all ate the same spiritual food,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were cut down in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">These things happened as examples for us, so that we will not crave evil things as they did.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “ The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">And let us not be immoral, as some of them were, and twenty-three thousand died in a single day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.</verse>
				<verse number="11">These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall.</verse>
				<verse number="13">No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others. And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.</verse>
				<verse number="15">I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ?</verse>
				<verse number="17">Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything?</verse>
				<verse number="20">No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.</verse>
				<verse number="21">You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?</verse>
				<verse number="23">“Everything is lawful,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is lawful,” but not everything builds others up.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience,</verse>
				<verse number="26">for the earth and its abundance are the Lord’s.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if someone says to you, “This is from a sacrifice,” do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience —</verse>
				<verse number="29">I do not mean yours but the other person’s. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience?</verse>
				<verse number="30">If I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for the food that I give thanks for?</verse>
				<verse number="31">So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,</verse>
				<verse number="33">just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I praise you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I passed them on to you.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head, for it is one and the same thing as having a shaved head.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for man.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For this reason a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In any case, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But all things come from God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him,</verse>
				<verse number="15">but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If anyone intends to quarrel about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For in the first place, when you come together as a church I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For there must in fact be divisions among you, so that those of you who are approved may be evident.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now when you come together at the same place, you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For when it is time to eat, everyone proceeds with his own supper. One is hungry and another becomes drunk.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Do you not have houses so that you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show contempt for the church of God by shaming those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!</verse>
				<verse number="23">For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and after he had given thanks he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</verse>
				<verse number="25">In the same way, he also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, every time you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">For every time you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="28">A person should examine himself first, and in this way let him eat the bread and drink of the cup.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For the one who eats and drinks without careful regard for the body eats and drinks judgment against himself.</verse>
				<verse number="30">That is why many of you are weak and sick, and quite a few are dead.</verse>
				<verse number="31">But if we examined ourselves, we would not be judged.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned with the world.</verse>
				<verse number="33">So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
				<verse number="34">If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you assemble it does not lead to judgment. I will give directions about other matters when I come.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">With regard to spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And there are different ministries, but the same Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="7">To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="9">to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="10">to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body — though many — are one body, so too is Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or free, we were all made to drink of the one Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For in fact the body is not a single member, but many.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If the foot says, “Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And if the ear says, “Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that.</verse>
				<verse number="17">If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would exercise the sense of smell?</verse>
				<verse number="18">But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided.</verse>
				<verse number="19">If they were all the same member, where would the body be?</verse>
				<verse number="20">So now there are many members, but one body.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” nor in turn can the head say to the foot, “I do not need you.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential,</verse>
				<verse number="23">and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member,</verse>
				<verse number="25">so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another.</verse>
				<verse number="26">If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored, all rejoice with it.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you is a member of it.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they?</verse>
				<verse number="30">Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</verse>
				<verse number="31">But you should be eager for the greater gifts. And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast, but do not have love, I receive no benefit.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up.</verse>
				<verse number="5">It is not rude, it is not self-serving, it is not easily angered or resentful.</verse>
				<verse number="6">It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but when what is perfect comes, the partial will be set aside.</verse>
				<verse number="11">When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult, I set aside childish ways.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For now we see in a mirror indirectly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Pursue love and be eager for the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no one understands; he is speaking mysteries by the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and consolation.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be strengthened.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</verse>
				<verse number="7">It is similar for lifeless things that make a sound, like a flute or harp. Unless they make a distinction in the notes, how can what is played on the flute or harp be understood?</verse>
				<verse number="8">If, for example, the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
				<verse number="9">It is the same for you. If you do not speak clearly with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
				<verse number="10">There are probably many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.</verse>
				<verse number="11">If then I do not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It is the same with you. Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, seek to abound in order to strengthen the church.</verse>
				<verse number="13">So then, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive.</verse>
				<verse number="15">What should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praises with my spirit, but I will also sing praises with my mind.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Otherwise, if you are praising God with your spirit, how can someone without the gift say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
				<verse number="17">For you are certainly giving thanks well, but the other person is not strengthened.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking. Instead, be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.</verse>
				<verse number="21">It is written in the law: “ By people with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, yet not even in this way will they listen to me,” says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="22">So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So if the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and unbelievers or uninformed people enter, will they not say that you have lost your minds?</verse>
				<verse number="24">But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninformed person enters, he will be convicted by all, he will be called to account by all.</verse>
				<verse number="25">The secrets of his heart are disclosed, and in this way he will fall down with his face to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is really among you.”</verse>
				<verse number="26">What should you do then, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each one has a song, has a lesson, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all these things be done for the strengthening of the church.</verse>
				<verse number="27">If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two, or at the most three, one after the other, and someone must interpret.</verse>
				<verse number="28">But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church. Let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Two or three prophets should speak and the others should evaluate what is said.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And if someone sitting down receives a revelation, the person who is speaking should conclude.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For you can all prophesy one after another, so all can learn and be encouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Indeed, the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,</verse>
				<verse number="33">for God is not characterized by disorder but by peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
				<verse number="34">the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. Rather, let them be in submission, as in fact the law says.</verse>
				<verse number="35">If they want to find out about something, they should ask their husbands at home, because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
				<verse number="36">Did the word of God begin with you, or did it come to you alone?</verse>
				<verse number="37">If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord’s command.</verse>
				<verse number="38">If someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</verse>
				<verse number="39">So then, brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And do everything in a decent and orderly manner.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel that I preached to you, that you received and on which you stand,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you — unless you believed in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received — that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Last of all, as though to one born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain. In fact, I worked harder than all of them — yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Whether then it was I or they, this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now if Christ is being preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
				<verse number="13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Also, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified against God that he raised Christ from the dead, when in reality he did not raise him, if indeed the dead are not raised.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For if only in this life we have hope in Christ, we should be pitied more than anyone.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then when Christ comes, those who belong to him.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he has brought to an end all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="26">The last enemy to be eliminated is death.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For he has put everything in subjection under his feet. But when it says “everything” has been put in subjection, it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are they baptized for them?</verse>
				<verse number="30">Why too are we in danger every hour?</verse>
				<verse number="31">Every day I am in danger of death! This is as sure as my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="32">If from a human point of view I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what did it benefit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”</verse>
				<verse number="34">Sober up as you should, and stop sinning! For some have no knowledge of God — I say this to your shame!</verse>
				<verse number="35">But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”</verse>
				<verse number="36">Fool! What you sow will not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
				<verse number="37">And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed — perhaps of wheat or something else.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But God gives it a body just as he planned, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.</verse>
				<verse number="39">All flesh is not the same: People have one flesh, animals have another, birds and fish another.</verse>
				<verse number="40">And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another.</verse>
				<verse number="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
				<verse number="42">It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.</verse>
				<verse number="43">It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
				<verse number="44">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
				<verse number="45">So also it is written, “ The first man, Adam, became a living person ”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="46">However, the spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.</verse>
				<verse number="47">The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="48">Like the one made of dust, so too are those made of dust, and like the one from heaven, so too those who are heavenly.</verse>
				<verse number="49">And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="50">Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</verse>
				<verse number="51">Listen, I will tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed —</verse>
				<verse number="52">in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</verse>
				<verse number="53">For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.</verse>
				<verse number="54">Now when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will happen, “ Death has been swallowed up in victory.”</verse>
				<verse number="55">“ Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? ”</verse>
				<verse number="56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
				<verse number="57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="58">So then, dear brothers and sisters, be firm. Do not be moved! Always be outstanding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">With regard to the collection for the saints, please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
				<verse number="2">On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some income and save it to the extent that God has blessed you, so that a collection will not have to be made when I come.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then, when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And if it seems advisable that I should go also, they will go with me.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia — for I will be going through Macedonia —</verse>
				<verse number="6">and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can send me on my journey, wherever I go.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For I do not want to see you now in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
				<verse number="9">because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me, but there are many opponents.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I am too.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So then, let no one treat him with contempt. But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers.</verse>
				<verse number="12">With regard to our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was simply not his intention to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Everything you do should be done in love.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now, brothers and sisters, you know about the household of Stephanus, that as the first converts of Achaia, they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints. I urge you</verse>
				<verse number="16">also to submit to people like this, and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus, Fortunatus, and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours. So then, recognize people like this.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, with the church that meets in their house.</verse>
				<verse number="20">All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I, Paul, send this greeting with my own hand.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed. Our Lord, come!</verse>
				<verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="47">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who comforts us in all our troubles so that we may be able to comfort those experiencing any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow toward us, so also our comfort through Christ overflows to you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that you experience in your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And our hope for you is steadfast because we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, regarding the affliction that happened to us in the province of Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of living.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Indeed we felt as if the sentence of death had been passed against us, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He delivered us from so great a risk of death, and he will deliver us. We have set our hope on him that he will deliver us yet again,</verse>
				<verse number="11">as you also join in helping us by prayer, so that many people may give thanks to God on our behalf for the gracious gift given to us through the help of many.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For our reason for confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with pure motives and sincerity which are from God — not by human wisdom but by the grace of God — we conducted ourselves in the world, and all the more toward you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For we do not write you anything other than what you can read and also understand. But I hope that you will understand completely</verse>
				<verse number="14">just as also you have partly understood us, that we are your source of pride just as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And with this confidence I intended to come to you first so that you would get a second opportunity to see us,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and through your help to go on into Macedonia and then from Macedonia to come back to you and be helped on our way into Judea by you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore when I was planning to do this, I did not do so without thinking about what I was doing, did I? Or do I make my plans according to mere human standards so that I would be saying both “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time?</verse>
				<verse number="18">But as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us — by me and Silvanus and Timothy — was not “Yes” and “No,” but it has always been “Yes” in him.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For every one of God’s promises are “Yes” in him; therefore also through him the “Amen” is spoken, to the glory we give to God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But it is God who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anointed us,</verse>
				<verse number="22">who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now I appeal to God as my witness, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth.</verse>
				<verse number="24">I do not mean that we rule over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">So I made up my own mind not to pay you another painful visit.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if I make you sad, who would be left to make me glad but the one I caused to be sad?</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I wrote this very thing to you, so that when I came I would not have sadness from those who ought to make me rejoice, since I am confident in you all that my joy would be yours.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if anyone has caused sadness, he has not saddened me alone, but to some extent (not to exaggerate) he has saddened all of you as well.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This punishment on such an individual by the majority is enough for him,</verse>
				<verse number="7">so that now instead you should rather forgive and comfort him. This will keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive grief to the point of despair.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this reason also I wrote you: to test you to see if you are obedient in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If you forgive anyone for anything, I also forgive him — for indeed what I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) I did so for you in the presence of Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="11">so that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes).</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now when I arrived in Troas to proclaim the gospel of Christ, even though the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me,</verse>
				<verse number="13">I had no relief in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-bye to them and set out for Macedonia.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that consists of the knowledge of him in every place.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing —</verse>
				<verse number="16">to the latter an odor from death to death, but to the former a fragrance from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?</verse>
				<verse number="17">For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit, but we are speaking in Christ before God as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? We don’t need letters of recommendation to you or from you as some other people do, do we?</verse>
				<verse number="2">You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone,</verse>
				<verse number="3">revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now we have such confidence in God through Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as if it were coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,</verse>
				<verse number="6">who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But if the ministry that produced death — carved in letters on stone tablets — came with glory, so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (a glory which was made ineffective),</verse>
				<verse number="8">how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?</verse>
				<verse number="9">For if there was glory in the ministry that produced condemnation, how much more does the ministry that produces righteousness excel in glory!</verse>
				<verse number="10">For indeed, what had been glorious now has no glory because of the tremendously greater glory of what replaced it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For if what was made ineffective came with glory, how much more has what remains come in glory!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, since we have such a hope, we behave with great boldness,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and not like Moses who used to put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from staring at the result of the glory that was made ineffective.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But their minds were closed. For to this very day, the same veil remains when they hear the old covenant read. It has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But until this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds,</verse>
				<verse number="16">but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there is freedom.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as God has shown us mercy, we do not become discouraged.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But we have rejected shameful hidden deeds, not behaving with deceptiveness or distorting the word of God, but by open proclamation of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience before God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing,</verse>
				<verse number="4">among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe so they would not see the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For God, who said “ Let light shine out of darkness,” is the one who shined in our hearts to give us the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.</verse>
				<verse number="8">We are experiencing trouble on every side, but are not crushed; we are perplexed, but not driven to despair;</verse>
				<verse number="9">we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed,</verse>
				<verse number="10">always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our body.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For we who are alive are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our mortal body.</verse>
				<verse number="12">As a result, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But since we have the same spirit of faith as that shown in what has been written, “ I believed; therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We do so because we know that the one who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and will bring us with you into his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For all these things are for your sake, so that the grace that is including more and more people may cause thanksgiving to increase to the glory of God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore we do not despair, but even if our physical body is wearing away, our inner person is being renewed day by day.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For our momentary, light suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison</verse>
				<verse number="18">because we are not looking at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen. For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">For we know that if our earthly house, the tent we live in, is dismantled, we have a building from God, a house not built by human hands, that is eternal in the heavens.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For in this earthly house we groan, because we desire to put on our heavenly dwelling,</verse>
				<verse number="3">if indeed, after we have put on our heavenly house, we will not be found naked.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For we groan while we are in this tent, since we are weighed down, because we do not want to be unclothed, but clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore we are always full of courage, and we know that as long as we are alive here on earth we are absent from the Lord —</verse>
				<verse number="7">for we live by faith, not by sight.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Thus we are full of courage and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So then whether we are alive or away, we make it our ambition to please him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be paid back according to what he has done while in the body, whether good or evil.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people, but we are well known to God, and I hope we are well known to your consciences too.</verse>
				<verse number="12">We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who take pride in outward appearance and not in what is in the heart.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For the love of Christ controls us, since we have concluded this, that Christ died for all; therefore all have died.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So then from now on we acknowledge no one from an outward human point of view. Even though we have known Christ from such a human point of view, now we do not know him in that way any longer.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So then, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; what is old has passed away — look, what is new has come!</verse>
				<verse number="18">And all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His plea through us. We plead with you on Christ’s behalf, “Be reconciled to God!”</verse>
				<verse number="21">God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we would become the righteousness of God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For he says, “ I heard you at the acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Look, now is the acceptable time; look, now is the day of salvation!</verse>
				<verse number="3">We do not give anyone an occasion for taking an offense in anything, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But as God’s servants, we have commended ourselves in every way, with great endurance, in persecutions, in difficulties, in distresses,</verse>
				<verse number="5">in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in hunger,</verse>
				<verse number="6">by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by benevolence, by the Holy Spirit, by genuine love,</verse>
				<verse number="7">by truthful teaching, by the power of God, with weapons of righteousness both for the right hand and for the left,</verse>
				<verse number="8">through glory and dishonor, through slander and praise; regarded as impostors, and yet true;</verse>
				<verse number="9">as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying and yet — see! — we continue to live; as those who are scourged and yet not executed;</verse>
				<verse number="10">as sorrowful, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</verse>
				<verse number="11">We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Our affection for you is not restricted, but you are restricted in your affections for us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now as a fair exchange — I speak as to my children — open wide your hearts to us also.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Do not become partners with those who do not believe, for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship does light have with darkness?</verse>
				<verse number="15">And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever?</verse>
				<verse number="16">And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “ I will live in them and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore “ come out from their midst, and be separate,” says the Lord, “ and touch no unclean thing, and I will welcome you,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,” says the All-Powerful Lord.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Make room for us in your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have ruined no one, we have exploited no one.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I do not say this to condemn you, for I told you before that you are in our hearts so that we die together and live together with you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I have great confidence in you; I take great pride on your behalf. I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in the midst of all our suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For even when we came into Macedonia, our body had no rest at all, but we were troubled in every way — struggles from the outside, fears from within.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But God, who encourages the downhearted, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">We were encouraged not only by his arrival, but also by the encouragement you gave him, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your deep concern for me, so that I rejoiced more than ever.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For even if I made you sad by my letter, I do not regret having written it (even though I did regret it, for I see that my letter made you sad, though only for a short time).</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now I rejoice, not because you were made sad, but because you were made sad to the point of repentance. For you were made sad as God intended, so that you were not harmed in any way by us.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For sadness as intended by God produces a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret, but worldly sadness brings about death.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For see what this very thing, this sadness as God intended, has produced in you: what eagerness, what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what deep concern, what punishment! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong, or on account of the one who was wronged, but to reveal to you your eagerness on our behalf before God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore we have been encouraged. And in addition to our own encouragement, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you, I have not been embarrassed by you, but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proved true as well.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And his affection for you is much greater when he remembers the obedience of you all, how you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I rejoice because in everything I am fully confident in you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now we make known to you, brothers and sisters, the grace of God given to the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
				<verse number="2">that during a severe ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their generosity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For I testify, they gave according to their means and beyond their means. They did so voluntarily,</verse>
				<verse number="4">begging us with great earnestness for the blessing and fellowship of helping the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And they did this not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us by the will of God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Thus we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun this work, so also he should complete this act of kindness for you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But as you excel in everything — in faith, in speech, in knowledge, and in all eagerness and in the love from us that is in you — make sure that you excel in this act of kindness too.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I am not saying this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love by comparison with the eagerness of others.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, he became poor for your sakes, so that you by his poverty could become rich.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So here is my opinion on this matter: It is to your advantage, since you made a good start last year both in your giving and your desire to give,</verse>
				<verse number="11">to finish what you started, so that just as you wanted to do it eagerly, you can also complete it according to your means.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For if the eagerness is present, the gift itself is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For I do not say this so there would be relief for others and suffering for you, but as a matter of equality.</verse>
				<verse number="14">At the present time, your abundance will meet their need, so that one day their abundance may also meet your need, and thus there may be equality,</verse>
				<verse number="15">as it is written: “ The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you,</verse>
				<verse number="17">because he not only accepted our request, but since he was very eager, he is coming to you of his own accord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In addition, this brother has also been chosen by the churches as our traveling companion as we administer this generous gift to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help.</verse>
				<verse number="20">We did this as a precaution so that no one should blame us in regard to this generous gift we are administering.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For we are concerned about what is right not only before the Lord but also before men.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times and found eager in many matters, but who now is much more eager than ever because of the great confidence he has in you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">If there is any question about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; if there is any question about our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore show them openly before the churches the proof of your love and of our pride in you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">For it is not necessary for me to write you about this service to the saints,</verse>
				<verse number="2">because I know your eagerness to help. I keep boasting to the Macedonians about this eagerness of yours, that Achaia has been ready to give since last year, and your zeal to participate has stirred up most of them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But I am sending these brothers so that our boasting about you may not be empty in this case, so that you may be ready just as I kept telling them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if any of the Macedonians should come with me and find that you are not ready to give, we would be humiliated (not to mention you) by this confidence we had in you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Therefore I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you in advance and to arrange ahead of time the generous contribution you had promised, so this may be ready as a generous gift and not as something you feel forced to do.</verse>
				<verse number="6">My point is this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Each one of you should give just as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, because God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And God is able to make all grace overflow to you so that because you have enough of everything in every way at all times, you will overflow in every good work.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Just as it is written, “ He has scattered widely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now God who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your supply of seed and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous on every occasion, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God,</verse>
				<verse number="12">because the service of this ministry is not only providing for the needs of the saints but is also overflowing with many thanks to God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Through the evidence of this service they will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession in the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your sharing with them and with everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And in their prayers on your behalf they long for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown to you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Now I, Paul, appeal to you personally by the meekness and gentleness of Christ (I who am meek when present among you, but am full of courage toward you when away!) —</verse>
				<verse number="2">now I ask that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that (I expect) I will dare to use against some who consider us to be behaving according to human standards.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For though we live as human beings, we do not wage war according to human standards,</verse>
				<verse number="4">for the weapons of our warfare are not human weapons, but are made powerful by God for tearing down strongholds. We tear down arguments</verse>
				<verse number="5">and every arrogant obstacle that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to make it obey Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We are also ready to punish every act of disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You are looking at outward appearances. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should reflect on this again: Just as he himself belongs to Christ, so too do we.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of doing so.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I do not want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters,</verse>
				<verse number="10">because some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his physical presence is weak and his speech is of no account.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Let such a person consider this: What we say by letters when we are absent, we also are in actions when we are present.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For we would not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But we will not boast beyond certain limits, but will confine our boasting according to the limits of the work to which God has appointed us, that reaches even as far as you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we were not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach as far as you, because we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel about Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Nor do we boast beyond certain limits in the work done by others, but we hope that as your faith continues to grow, our work may be greatly expanded among you according to our limits,</verse>
				<verse number="16">so that we may preach the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast of work already done in another person’s area.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the one who boasts must boast in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For it is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person the Lord commends.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">I wish that you would be patient with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you are being patient with me!</verse>
				<verse number="2">For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his treachery, your minds may be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus different from the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the one you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it well enough!</verse>
				<verse number="5">For I consider myself not at all inferior to those “super-apostles.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">And even if I am unskilled in speaking, yet I am certainly not so in knowledge. Indeed, we have made this plain to you in everything in every way.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you could be exalted, because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you free of charge?</verse>
				<verse number="8">I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so that I could serve you!</verse>
				<verse number="9">When I was with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia fully supplied my needs. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</verse>
				<verse number="10">As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
				<verse number="12">And what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may eliminate any opportunity for those who want a chance to be regarded as our equals in the things they boast about.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Therefore it is not surprising his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will correspond to their actions.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I say again, let no one think that I am a fool. But if you do, then at least accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</verse>
				<verse number="17">What I am saying with this boastful confidence I do not say the way the Lord would. Instead it is, as it were, foolishness.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Since many are boasting according to human standards, I too will boast.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For since you are so wise, you put up with fools gladly.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For you put up with it if someone makes slaves of you, if someone exploits you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone behaves arrogantly toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.</verse>
				<verse number="21">(To my disgrace I must say that we were too weak for that!) But whatever anyone else dares to boast about (I am speaking foolishly), I also dare to boast about the same thing.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking like I am out of my mind!) I am even more so: with much greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with more severe beatings, facing death many times.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes less one.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Three times I was beaten with a rod. Once I received a stoning. Three times I suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I spent adrift in the open sea.</verse>
				<verse number="26">I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers from false brothers,</verse>
				<verse number="27">in hard work and toil, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, many times without food, in cold and without enough clothing.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxious concern for all the churches.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with indignation?</verse>
				<verse number="30">If I must boast, I will boast about the things that show my weakness.</verse>
				<verse number="31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows I am not lying.</verse>
				<verse number="32">In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to arrest me,</verse>
				<verse number="33">but I was let down in a rope-basket through a window in the city wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">It is necessary to go on boasting. Though it is not profitable, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows) was caught up to the third heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I know that this man (whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows)</verse>
				<verse number="4">was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred to be put into words, things that a person is not permitted to speak.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On behalf of such an individual I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For even if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I would be telling the truth, but I refrain from this so that no one may regard me beyond what he sees in me or what he hears from me,</verse>
				<verse number="7">even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not become arrogant, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to trouble me — so that I would not become arrogant.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I asked the Lord three times about this, that it would depart from me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” So then, I will boast most gladly about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may reside in me.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Therefore I am content with weaknesses, with insults, with troubles, with persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I have become a fool. You yourselves forced me to do it, for I should have been commended by you. For I lack nothing in comparison to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Indeed, the signs of an apostle were performed among you with great perseverance by signs and wonders and powerful deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For how were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this injustice!</verse>
				<verse number="14">Look, for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you, because I do not want your possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Now I will most gladly spend and be spent for your lives! If I love you more, am I to be loved less?</verse>
				<verse number="16">But be that as it may, I have not burdened you. Yet because I was a crafty person, I took you in by deceit!</verse>
				<verse number="17">I have not taken advantage of you through anyone I have sent to you, have I?</verse>
				<verse number="18">I urged Titus to visit you and I sent our brother along with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we not behave in the same way?</verse>
				<verse number="19">Have you been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in Christ before God, and everything we do, dear friends, is to build you up.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For I am afraid that somehow when I come I will not find you what I wish, and you will find me not what you wish. I am afraid that somehow there may be quarreling, jealousy, intense anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I am afraid that when I come again, my God may humiliate me before you, and I will grieve for many of those who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and licentiousness that they have practiced.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">This is the third time I am coming to visit you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be established.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I said before when I was present the second time and now, though absent, I say again to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare anyone,</verse>
				<verse number="3">since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you but is powerful among you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For indeed he was crucified by reason of weakness, but he lives because of God’s power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him, because of God’s power toward you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Put yourselves to the test to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you — unless, indeed, you fail the test!</verse>
				<verse number="6">And I hope that you will realize that we have not failed the test!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now we pray to God that you may not do anything wrong, not so that we may appear to have passed the test, but so that you may do what is right even if we may appear to have failed the test.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the sake of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And we pray for this: that you may become fully qualified.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Because of this I am writing these things while absent, so that when I arrive I may not have to deal harshly with you by using my authority — the Lord gave it to me for building up, not for tearing down!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, set things right, be encouraged, agree with one another, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor by human agency, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead)</verse>
				<verse number="2">and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="4">who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
				<verse number="5">to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel —</verse>
				<verse number="7">not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be condemned to hell!</verse>
				<verse number="9">As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell!</verse>
				<verse number="10">Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased</verse>
				<verse number="16">to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being,</verse>
				<verse number="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
				<verse number="19">But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you!</verse>
				<verse number="21">Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="23">They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</verse>
				<verse number="24">So they glorified God because of me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, taking Titus along too.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I went there because of a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did so only in a private meeting with the influential people, to make sure that I was not running — or had not run — in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now this matter arose because of the false brothers with false pretenses who slipped in unnoticed to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, to make us slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But we did not surrender to them even for a moment, in order that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But from those who were influential (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism between people ) — those influential leaders added nothing to my message.</verse>
				<verse number="7">On the contrary, when they saw that I was entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised just as Peter was to the circumcised</verse>
				<verse number="8">(for he who empowered Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also empowered me for my apostleship to the Gentiles)</verse>
				<verse number="9">and when James, Cephas, and John, who had a reputation as pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They requested only that we remember the poor, the very thing I also was eager to do.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had clearly done wrong.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Until certain people came from James, he had been eating with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself because he was afraid of those who were pro-circumcision.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And the rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But when I saw that they were not behaving consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, although you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</verse>
				<verse number="15">We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,</verse>
				<verse number="16">yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves have also been found to be sinners, is Christ then one who encourages sin? Absolutely not!</verse>
				<verse number="18">But if I build up again those things I once destroyed, I demonstrate that I am one who breaks God’s law.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For through the law I died to the law so that I may live to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So the life I now live in the body, I live because of the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I do not set aside God’s grace, because if righteousness could come through the law, then Christ died for nothing!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified!</verse>
				<verse number="2">The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Are you so foolish? Although you began with the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by human effort?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Have you suffered so many things for nothing? — if indeed it was for nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="7">so then, understand that those who believe are the sons of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel to Abraham ahead of time, saying, “ All the nations will be blessed in you.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So then those who believe are blessed along with Abraham the believer.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For all who rely on doing the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “ Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the book of the law.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now it is clear no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous one will live by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But the law is not based on faith, but the one who does the works of the law will live by them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us (because it is written, “ Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ”)</verse>
				<verse number="14">in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Brothers and sisters, I offer an example from everyday life: When a covenant has been ratified, even though it is only a human contract, no one can set it aside or add anything to it.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “and to the descendants,” referring to many, but “ and to your descendant,” referring to one, who is Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="17">What I am saying is this: The law that came four hundred thirty years later does not cancel a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to invalidate the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on the promise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the descendant to whom the promise had been made. It was administered through angels by an intermediary.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now an intermediary is not for one party alone, but God is one.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the scripture imprisoned everything and everyone under sin so that the promise could be given — because of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ — to those who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now before faith came we were held in custody under the law, being kept as prisoners until the coming faith would be revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Thus the law had become our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female — for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to the promise.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now I mean that the heir, as long as he is a minor, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.</verse>
				<verse number="3">So also we, when we were minors, were enslaved under the basic forces of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when the appropriate time had come, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
				<verse number="5">to redeem those who were under the law, so that we may be adopted as sons with full rights.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls “ Abba! Father!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Formerly when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods at all.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But now that you have come to know God (or rather to be known by God), how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless basic forces? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?</verse>
				<verse number="10">You are observing religious days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I fear for you that my work for you may have been in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I beg you, brothers and sisters, become like me, because I have become like you. You have done me no wrong!</verse>
				<verse number="13">But you know it was because of a physical illness that I first proclaimed the gospel to you,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as though I were an angel of God, as though I were Christ Jesus himself!</verse>
				<verse number="15">Where then is your sense of happiness now? For I testify about you that if it were possible, you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me!</verse>
				<verse number="16">So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?</verse>
				<verse number="17">They court you eagerly, but for no good purpose; they want to exclude you, so that you would seek them eagerly.</verse>
				<verse number="18">However, it is good to be sought eagerly for a good purpose at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
				<verse number="19">My children — I am again undergoing birth pains until Christ is formed in you!</verse>
				<verse number="20">I wish I could be with you now and change my tone of voice, because I am perplexed about you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not understand the law?</verse>
				<verse number="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But one, the son by the slave woman, was born by natural descent, while the other, the son by the free woman, was born through the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="24">These things may be treated as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</verse>
				<verse number="26">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For it is written: “ Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear children; break forth and shout, you who have no birth pains, because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband.”</verse>
				<verse number="28">But you, brothers and sisters, are children of the promise like Isaac.</verse>
				<verse number="29">But just as at that time the one born by natural descent persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</verse>
				<verse number="30">But what does the scripture say? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the son ” of the free woman.</verse>
				<verse number="31">Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you at all!</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!</verse>
				<verse number="5">For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight — the only thing that matters is faith working through love.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You were running well; who prevented you from obeying the truth?</verse>
				<verse number="8">This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you!</verse>
				<verse number="9">A little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise!</verse>
				<verse number="10">I am confident in the Lord that you will accept no other view. But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty, whoever he may be.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now, brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I wish those agitators would go so far as to castrate themselves!</verse>
				<verse number="13">For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity to indulge your flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For the whole law can be summed up in a single commandment, namely, “ You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">However, if you continually bite and devour one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But I say, live by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For the flesh has desires that are opposed to the Spirit, and the Spirit has desires that are opposed to the flesh, for these are in opposition to each other, so that you cannot do what you want.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, depravity,</verse>
				<verse number="20">idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish rivalries, dissensions, factions,</verse>
				<verse number="21">envying, murder, drunkenness, carousing, and similar things. I am warning you, as I had warned you before: Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God!</verse>
				<verse number="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
				<verse number="23">gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</verse>
				<verse number="25">If we live by the Spirit, let us also behave in accordance with the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, being jealous of one another.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Brothers and sisters, if a person is discovered in some sin, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness. Pay close attention to yourselves, so that you are not tempted too.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Let each one examine his own work. Then he can take pride in himself and not compare himself with someone else.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For each one will carry his own load.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now the one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with the one who teaches it.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Do not be deceived. God will not be made a fool. For a person will reap what he sows,</verse>
				<verse number="8">because the person who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So we must not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not give up.</verse>
				<verse number="10">So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the family of faith.</verse>
				<verse number="11">See what big letters I make as I write to you with my own hand!</verse>
				<verse number="12">Those who want to make a good showing in external matters are trying to force you to be circumcised. They do so only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that matters is a new creation!</verse>
				<verse number="16">And all who will behave in accordance with this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints [in Ephesus], the faithful in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we may be holy and unblemished in his sight in love.</verse>
				<verse number="5">He did this by predestining us to adoption as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of his will —</verse>
				<verse number="6">to the praise of the glory of his grace that he has freely bestowed on us in his dearly loved Son.</verse>
				<verse number="7">In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace</verse>
				<verse number="8">that he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He did this when he revealed to us the secret of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="10">toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ — the things in heaven and the things on earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In Christ we too have been claimed as God’s own possession, since we were predestined according to the one purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will</verse>
				<verse number="12">so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, would be to the praise of his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And when you heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation) — when you believed in Christ — you were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="14">who is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
				<verse number="16">I do not cease to give thanks for you when I remember you in my prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you spiritual wisdom and revelation in your growing knowledge of him,</verse>
				<verse number="18">— since the eyes of your heart have been enlightened — so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and what is the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe, as displayed in the exercise of his immense strength.</verse>
				<verse number="20">This power he exercised in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms</verse>
				<verse number="21">far above every rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And God put all things under Christ’s feet, and he gave him to the church as head over all things.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now the church is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">And although you were dead in your transgressions and sins,</verse>
				<verse number="2">in which you formerly lived according to this world’s present path, according to the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the ruler of the spirit that is now energizing the sons of disobedience,</verse>
				<verse number="3">among whom all of us also formerly lived out our lives in the cravings of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest…</verse>
				<verse number="4">But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
				<verse number="5">even though we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ — by grace you are saved! —</verse>
				<verse number="6">and he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="7">to demonstrate in the coming ages the surpassing wealth of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;</verse>
				<verse number="9">it is not from works, so that no one can boast.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh — who are called “uncircumcision” by the so-called “circumcision” that is performed on the body by human hands —</verse>
				<verse number="12">that you were at that time without the Messiah, alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But now in Christ Jesus you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For he is our peace, the one who made both groups into one and who destroyed the middle wall of partition, the hostility,</verse>
				<verse number="15">when he nullified in his flesh the law of commandments in decrees. He did this to create in himself one new man out of two, thus making peace,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and to reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by which the hostility has been killed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near,</verse>
				<verse number="18">so that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="19">So then you are no longer foreigners and noncitizens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household,</verse>
				<verse number="20">because you have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.</verse>
				<verse number="21">In him the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="22">in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles —</verse>
				<verse number="2">if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,</verse>
				<verse number="3">that by revelation the divine secret was made known to me, as I wrote before briefly.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When reading this, you will be able to understand my insight into this secret of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now this secret was not disclosed to people in former generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="6">namely, that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the exercise of his power.</verse>
				<verse number="8">To me — less than the least of all the saints — this grace was given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ</verse>
				<verse number="9">and to enlighten everyone about God’s secret plan — a secret that has been hidden for ages in God who has created all things.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="12">in whom we have boldness and confident access to God because of Christ’s faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For this reason I kneel before the Father,</verse>
				<verse number="15">from whom every family in heaven and on the earth is named.</verse>
				<verse number="16">I pray that according to the wealth of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,</verse>
				<verse number="17">that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, so that, because you have been rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
				<verse number="18">you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
				<verse number="19">and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think,</verse>
				<verse number="21">to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">I, therefore, the prisoner for the Lord, urge you to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called,</verse>
				<verse number="2">with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,</verse>
				<verse number="3">making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="4">There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling,</verse>
				<verse number="5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
				<verse number="6">one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Therefore it says, “ When he ascended on high he captured captives; he gave gifts to men.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now what is the meaning of “ he ascended,” except that he also descended to the lower regions, namely, the earth?</verse>
				<verse number="10">He, the very one who descended, is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.</verse>
				<verse number="11">It was he who gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,</verse>
				<verse number="12">to equip the saints for the work of ministry, that is, to build up the body of Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="13">until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God — a mature person, attaining to the measure of Christ’s full stature.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So we are no longer to be children, tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching by the trickery of people who craftily carry out their deceitful schemes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But practicing the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ, who is the head.</verse>
				<verse number="16">From him the whole body grows, fitted and held together through every supporting ligament. As each one does its part, the body grows in love.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So I say this, and insist in the Lord, that you no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They are darkened in their understanding, being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Because they are callous, they have given themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But you did not learn about Christ like this,</verse>
				<verse number="21">if indeed you heard about him and were taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You were taught with reference to your former way of life to lay aside the old man who is being corrupted in accordance with deceitful desires,</verse>
				<verse number="23">to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and to put on the new man who has been created in God’s image — in righteousness and holiness that comes from truth.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Therefore, having laid aside falsehood, each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Do not give the devil an opportunity.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The one who steals must steal no longer; rather he must labor, doing good with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with the one who has need.</verse>
				<verse number="29">You must let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but only what is beneficial for the building up of the one in need, that it may give grace to those who hear.</verse>
				<verse number="30">And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
				<verse number="31">You must put away every kind of bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and evil, slanderous talk.</verse>
				<verse number="32">Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, be imitators of God as dearly loved children</verse>
				<verse number="2">and live in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting — all of which are out of character — but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Let nobody deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore do not be partakers with them,</verse>
				<verse number="8">for you were at one time darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light —</verse>
				<verse number="9">for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth —</verse>
				<verse number="10">trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But all things being exposed by the light are made evident.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For everything made evident is light, and for this reason it says: “Awake, O sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Therefore be very careful how you live — not as unwise but as wise,</verse>
				<verse number="16">taking advantage of every opportunity, because the days are evil.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise by understanding what the Lord’s will is.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And do not get drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="19">speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="20">always giving thanks to God the Father for each other in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="23">because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church — he himself being the savior of the body.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her</verse>
				<verse number="26">to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word,</verse>
				<verse number="27">so that he may present the church to himself as glorious — not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.</verse>
				<verse number="28">In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For no one has ever hated his own body but he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ also does the church,</verse>
				<verse number="30">for we are members of his body.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="32">This mystery is great — but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.</verse>
				<verse number="2">“ Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment accompanied by a promise, namely,</verse>
				<verse number="3">“ that it may go well with you and that you will live a long time on the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but raise them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="6">not like those who do their work only when someone is watching — as people-pleasers — but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Obey with enthusiasm, as though serving the Lord and not people,</verse>
				<verse number="8">because you know that each person, whether slave or free, if he does something good, this will be rewarded by the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Masters, treat your slaves the same way, giving up the use of threats, because you know that both you and they have the same master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Finally, be strengthened in the Lord and in the strength of his power.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Clothe yourselves with the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For this reason, take up the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand your ground on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Stand firm therefore, by fastening the belt of truth around your waist, by putting on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="15">by fitting your feet with the preparation that comes from the good news of peace,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and in all of this, by taking up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="18">With every prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit, and to this end be alert, with all perseverance and requests for all the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Pray for me also, that I may be given the message when I begin to speak — that I may confidently make known the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
				<verse number="20">for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may be able to speak boldly as I ought to speak.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Tychicus, my dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make everything known to you, so that you too may know about my circumstances, how I am doing.</verse>
				<verse number="22">I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Grace be with all of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="50">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="3">I thank my God every time I remember you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you</verse>
				<verse number="5">because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I am sure of this very thing, that the one who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners in God’s grace together with me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And I pray this, that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight</verse>
				<verse number="10">so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="11">filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel:</verse>
				<verse number="13">The whole imperial guard and everyone else knows that I am in prison for the sake of Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and most of the brothers and sisters, having confidence in the Lord because of my imprisonment, now more than ever dare to speak the word fearlessly.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="18">What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</verse>
				<verse number="19">for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="20">My confident hope is that I will in no way be ashamed but that with complete boldness, even now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether I live or die.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now if I am to go on living in the body, this will mean productive work for me, yet I don’t know which I prefer:</verse>
				<verse number="23">I feel torn between the two, because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but it is more vital for your sake that I remain in the body.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
				<verse number="26">so that what you can be proud of may increase because of me in Christ Jesus, when I come back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that — whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent — I should hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
				<verse number="28">and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of their destruction, but of your salvation — a sign which is from God.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For it has been granted to you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him,</verse>
				<verse number="30">since you are encountering the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort provided by love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any affection or mercy,</verse>
				<verse number="2">complete my joy and be of the same mind, by having the same love, being united in spirit, and having one purpose.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity, each of you should, in humility, be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Each of you should be concerned not only about your own interests, but about the interests of others as well.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had,</verse>
				<verse number="6">who though he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God as something to be grasped,</verse>
				<verse number="7">but emptied himself by taking on the form of a slave, by looking like other men, and by sharing in human nature.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He humbled himself, by becoming obedient to the point of death — even death on a cross!</verse>
				<verse number="9">As a result God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,</verse>
				<verse number="10">so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow — in heaven and on earth and under the earth —</verse>
				<verse number="11">and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence,</verse>
				<verse number="13">for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort — for the sake of his good pleasure — is God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Do everything without grumbling or arguing,</verse>
				<verse number="15">so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world</verse>
				<verse number="16">by holding on to the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice together with all of you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation,</verse>
				<verse number="24">though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you soon.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But for now I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. For he is my brother, coworker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to me in my need.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill.</verse>
				<verse number="27">In fact he became so ill that he nearly died. But God showed mercy to him — and not to him only, but also to me — so that I would not have grief on top of grief.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be free from anxiety.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,</verse>
				<verse number="30">since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! To write this again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God, exult in Christ Jesus, and do not rely on human credentials</verse>
				<verse number="4">— though mine too are significant. If someone thinks he has good reasons to put confidence in human credentials, I have more:</verse>
				<verse number="5">I was circumcised on the eighth day, from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. I lived according to the law as a Pharisee.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In my zeal for God I persecuted the church. According to the righteousness stipulated in the law I was blameless.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities because of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="8">More than that, I now regard all things as liabilities compared to the far greater value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things — indeed, I regard them as dung! — that I may gain Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and be found in him, not because I have my own righteousness derived from the law, but because I have the righteousness that comes by way of Christ’s faithfulness — a righteousness from God that is in fact based on Christ’s faithfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My aim is to know him, to experience the power of his resurrection, to share in his sufferings, and to be like him in his death,</verse>
				<verse number="11">and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Not that I have already attained this — that is, I have not already been perfected — but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself to have attained this. Instead I am single-minded: Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead,</verse>
				<verse number="14">with this goal in mind, I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Therefore let those of us who are “perfect” embrace this point of view. If you think otherwise, God will reveal to you the error of your ways.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Nevertheless, let us live up to the standard that we have already attained.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Be imitators of me, brothers and sisters, and watch carefully those who are living this way, just as you have us as an example.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For many live, about whom I have often told you, and now, with tears, I tell you that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, they exult in their shame, and they think about earthly things.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But our citizenship is in heaven — and we also await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="21">who will transform these humble bodies of ours into the likeness of his glorious body by means of that power by which he is able to subject all things to himself.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">So then, my brothers and sisters, dear friends whom I long to see, my joy and crown, stand in the Lord in this way, my dear friends!</verse>
				<verse number="2">I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yes, I say also to you, true companion, help them. They have struggled together in the gospel ministry along with me and Clement and my other coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Let everyone see your gentleness. The Lord is near!</verse>
				<verse number="6">Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if something is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these things. And the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">I have great joy in the Lord because now at last you have again expressed your concern for me. (Now I know you were concerned before but had no opportunity to do anything.)</verse>
				<verse number="11">I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I have experienced times of need and times of abundance. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment, whether I go satisfied or hungry, have plenty or nothing.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am able to do all things through the one who strengthens me.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And as you Philippians know, at the beginning of my gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in this matter of giving and receiving except you alone.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion you sent something for my need.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I do not say this because I am seeking a gift. Rather, I seek the credit that abounds to your account.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For I have received everything, and I have plenty. I have all I need because I received from Epaphroditus what you sent — a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, very pleasing to God.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And my God will supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">May glory be given to God our Father forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Give greetings to all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me here send greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="22">All the saints greet you, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>

				<verse number="5">Your faith and love have arisen from the hope laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard about in the message of truth, the gospel</verse>
				<verse number="6">that has come to you. Just as in the entire world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, so it has also been bearing fruit and growing among you from the first day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You learned the gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow slave — a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf —</verse>
				<verse number="8">who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For this reason we also, from the day we heard about you, have not ceased praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
				<verse number="10">so that you may live worthily of the Lord and please him in all respects — bearing fruit in every good deed, growing in the knowledge of God,</verse>
				<verse number="11">being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the display of all patience and steadfastness, joyfully</verse>
				<verse number="12">giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son he loves,</verse>
				<verse number="14">in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,</verse>
				<verse number="16">for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him — all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers — all things were created through him and for him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">He is the head of the body, the church, as well as the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead, so that he himself may become first in all things.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in the Son</verse>
				<verse number="20">and through him to reconcile all things to himself by making peace through the blood of his cross — through him, whether things on earth or things in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And you were at one time strangers and enemies in your minds as expressed through your evil deeds,</verse>
				<verse number="22">but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him —</verse>
				<verse number="23">if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm, without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has also been preached in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become its servant.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my physical body — for the sake of his body, the church — what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="25">I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship from God — given to me for you — in order to complete the word of God,</verse>
				<verse number="26">that is, the mystery that has been kept hidden from ages and generations, but has now been revealed to his saints.</verse>
				<verse number="27">God wanted to make known to them the glorious riches of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>
				<verse number="28">We proclaim him by instructing and teaching all people with all wisdom so that we may present every person mature in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Toward this goal I also labor, struggling according to his power that powerfully works in me.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those who have not met me face to face.</verse>
				<verse number="2">My goal is that their hearts, having been knit together in love, may be encouraged, and that they may have all the riches that assurance brings in their understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of God, namely, Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="3">in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I say this so that no one will deceive you through arguments that sound reasonable.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,</verse>
				<verse number="7">rooted and built up in him and firm in your faith just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty, deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and you have been filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority.</verse>
				<verse number="11">In him you also were circumcised — not, however, with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal of the fleshly body, that is, through the circumcision done by Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And even though you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he nevertheless made you alive with him, having forgiven all your transgressions.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He has destroyed what was against us, a certificate of indebtedness expressed in decrees opposed to us. He has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Disarming the rulers and authorities, he has made a public disgrace of them, triumphing over them by the cross.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore do not let anyone judge you with respect to food or drink, or in the matter of a feast, new moon, or Sabbath days —</verse>
				<verse number="17">these are only the shadow of the things to come, but the reality is Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels pass judgment on you. That person goes on at great lengths about what he has supposedly seen, but he is puffed up with empty notions by his fleshly mind.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He has not held fast to the head from whom the whole body, supported and knit together through its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit to them as though you lived in the world?</verse>
				<verse number="21">“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”</verse>
				<verse number="22">These are all destined to perish with use, founded as they are on human commands and teachings.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Even though they have the appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship and false humility achieved by an unsparing treatment of the body — a wisdom with no true value — they in reality result in fleshly indulgence.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Keep thinking about things above, not things on the earth,</verse>
				<verse number="3">for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When Christ (who is your life) appears, then you too will be revealed in glory with him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So put to death whatever in your nature belongs to the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, shameful passion, evil desire, and greed which is idolatry.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You also lived your lives in this way at one time, when you used to live among them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But now, put off all such things as anger, rage, malice, slander, abusive language from your mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with its practices</verse>
				<verse number="10">and have been clothed with the new man that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,</verse>
				<verse number="13">bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if someone happens to have a complaint against anyone else. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also forgive others.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And to all these virtues add love, which is the perfect bond.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Let the peace of Christ be in control in your heart (for you were in fact called as one body to this peace), and be thankful.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and exhorting one another with all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, all with grace in your hearts to God.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become disheartened.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Slaves, obey your earthly masters in every respect, not only when they are watching — like those who are strictly people-pleasers — but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Whatever you are doing, work at it with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not for people,</verse>
				<verse number="24">because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as the reward. Serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For the one who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there are no exceptions.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Masters, treat your slaves with justice and fairness, because you know that you also have a master in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
				<verse number="3">At the same time pray for us too, that God may open a door for the message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Pray that I may make it known as I should.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunities.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Tychicus, a dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me.</verse>
				<verse number="8">I sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="9">I sent him with Onesimus, the faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him).</verse>
				<verse number="11">And Jesus who is called Justus also sends greetings. In terms of Jewish converts, these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Epaphras, who is one of you and a slave of Christ, greets you. He is always struggling in prayer on your behalf, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For I can testify that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Our dear friend Luke the physician and Demas greet you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters who are in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And after you have read this letter, have it read to the church of Laodicea. In turn, read the letter from Laodicea as well.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And tell Archippus, “See to it that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">I, Paul, write this greeting by my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="52">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace and peace to you!</verse>
				<verse number="2">We thank God always for all of you as we mention you constantly in our prayers,</verse>
				<verse number="3">because we recall in the presence of our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you,</verse>
				<verse number="5">in that our gospel did not come to you merely in words, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction (surely you recall the character we displayed when we came among you to help you).</verse>
				<verse number="6">And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, despite great affliction.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread, so that we do not need to say anything.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For people everywhere report how you welcomed us and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God</verse>
				<verse number="10">and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, about our coming to you — it has not proven to be purposeless.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But although we suffered earlier and were mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of much opposition.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the appeal we make does not come from error or impurity or with deceit,</verse>
				<verse number="4">but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we declare it, not to please people but God, who examines our hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For we never appeared with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed — God is our witness —</verse>
				<verse number="6">nor to seek glory from people, either from you or from others,</verse>
				<verse number="7">although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ; instead we became little children among you. Like a nursing mother caring for her own children,</verse>
				<verse number="8">with such affection for you we were happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For you recall, brothers and sisters, our toil and drudgery: By working night and day so as not to impose a burden on any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You are witnesses, and so is God, as to how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct was toward you who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="11">As you know, we treated each one of you as a father treats his own children,</verse>
				<verse number="12">exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you live in a way worthy of God who calls you to his own kingdom and his glory.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And so we too constantly thank God that when you received God’s message that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human message, but as it truly is, God’s message, which is at work among you who believe.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For you became imitators, brothers and sisters, of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you too suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they in fact did from the Jews,</verse>
				<verse number="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us severely. They are displeasing to God and are opposed to all people,</verse>
				<verse number="16">because they hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they constantly fill up their measure of sins, but wrath has come upon them completely.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But when we were separated from you, brothers and sisters, for a short time (in presence, not in affection) we became all the more fervent in our great desire to see you in person.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For we wanted to come to you (I, Paul, in fact tried again and again) but Satan thwarted us.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not of course you?</verse>
				<verse number="20">For you are our glory and joy!</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">So when we could bear it no longer, we decided to stay on in Athens alone.</verse>
				<verse number="2">We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and encourage you about your faith,</verse>
				<verse number="3">so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For in fact when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we would suffer affliction, and so it has happened, as you well know.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter somehow tempted you and our toil had proven useless.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now Timothy has come to us from you and given us the good news of your faith and love and that you always think of us with affection and long to see us just as we also long to see you!</verse>
				<verse number="7">So in all our distress and affliction, we were reassured about you, brothers and sisters, through your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For now we are alive again, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For how can we thank God enough for you, for all the joy we feel because of you before our God?</verse>
				<verse number="10">We pray earnestly night and day to see you in person and make up what may be lacking in your faith.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now may God our Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you,</verse>
				<verse number="13">so that your hearts are strengthened in holiness to be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Finally then, brothers and sisters, we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received instruction from us about how you must live and please God (as you are in fact living) that you do so more and more.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For this is God’s will: that you become holy, that you keep away from sexual immorality,</verse>
				<verse number="4">that each of you know how to possess his own body in holiness and honor,</verse>
				<verse number="5">not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him, because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases, as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now on the topic of brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,</verse>
				<verse number="11">to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">In this way you will live a decent life before outsiders and not be in need.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep as Christians.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For we tell you this by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will surely not go ahead of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then we who are alive, who are left, will be suddenly caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Therefore encourage one another with these words.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Now on the topic of times and seasons, brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For you know quite well that the day of the Lord will come in the same way as a thief in the night.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now when they are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction comes on them, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will surely not escape.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the darkness for the day to overtake you like a thief would.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you all are sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So then we must not sleep as the rest, but must stay alert and sober.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For those who sleep, sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But since we are of the day, we must stay sober by putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet our hope for salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For God did not destine us for wrath but for gaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He died for us so that whether we are alert or asleep we will come to life together with him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, just as you are in fact doing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who labor among you and preside over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and to esteem them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And we urge you, brothers and sisters, admonish the undisciplined, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
				<verse number="15">See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Always rejoice,</verse>
				<verse number="17">constantly pray,</verse>
				<verse number="18">in everything give thanks. For this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Do not extinguish the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Do not treat prophecies with contempt.</verse>
				<verse number="21">But examine all things; hold fast to what is good.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Stay away from every form of evil.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now may the God of peace himself make you completely holy and may your spirit and soul and body be kept entirely blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He who calls you is trustworthy, and he will in fact do this.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Brothers and sisters, pray for us too.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.</verse>
				<verse number="27">I call on you solemnly in the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="53">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="3">We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, because your faith flourishes more and more and the love of each one of you all for one another is ever greater.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring.</verse>
				<verse number="5">This is evidence of God’s righteous judgment, to make you worthy of the kingdom of God, for which in fact you are suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For it is right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and to you who are being afflicted to give rest together with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels.</verse>
				<verse number="8">With flaming fire he will mete out punishment on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They will undergo the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength,</verse>
				<verse number="10">when he comes to be glorified among his saints and admired on that day among all who have believed — and you did in fact believe our testimony.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And in this regard we pray for you always, that our God will make you worthy of his calling and fulfill by his power your every desire for goodness and every work of faith,</verse>
				<verse number="12">that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Now regarding the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to be with him, we ask you, brothers and sisters,</verse>
				<verse number="2">not to be easily shaken from your composure or disturbed by any kind of spirit or message or letter allegedly from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not arrive until the rebellion comes and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, and as a result he takes his seat in God’s temple, displaying himself as God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Surely you recall that I used to tell you these things while I was still with you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And so you know what holds him back, so that he will be revealed in his own time.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the hidden power of lawlessness is already at work. However, the one who holds him back will do so until he is taken out of the way,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth and wipe out by the manifestation of his arrival.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The arrival of the lawless one will be by Satan’s working with all kinds of miracles and signs and false wonders,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and with every kind of evil deception directed against those who are perishing, because they found no place in their hearts for the truth so as to be saved.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Consequently God sends on them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And so all of them who have not believed the truth but have delighted in evil will be condemned.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He called you to this salvation through our gospel, so that you may possess the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Therefore, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold on to the traditions that we taught you, whether by speech or by letter.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,</verse>
				<verse number="17">encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good thing you do or say.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Finally, pray for us, brothers and sisters, that the Lord’s message may spread quickly and be honored as in fact it was among you,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil people. For not all have faith.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And we are confident about you in the Lord that you are both doing — and will do — what we are commanding.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God and the endurance of Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who lives an undisciplined life and not according to the tradition they received from us.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For you know yourselves how you must imitate us, because we did not behave without discipline among you,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and we did not eat anyone’s food without paying. Instead, in toil and drudgery we worked night and day in order not to burden any of you.</verse>
				<verse number="9">It was not because we do not have that right, but to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For even when we were with you, we used to give you this command: “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">For we hear that some among you are living an undisciplined life, not doing their own work but meddling in the work of others.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and so provide their own food to eat.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary in doing what is right.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter, take note of him and do not associate closely with him, so that he may be ashamed.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="3">As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings,</verse>
				<verse number="4">nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion.</verse>
				<verse number="7">They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately,</verse>
				<verse number="9">realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,</verse>
				<verse number="10">sexually immoral people, practicing homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers — in fact, for any who live contrary to sound teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This accords with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry,</verse>
				<verse number="13">even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,</verse>
				<verse number="14">and our Lord’s grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="15">This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners” — and I am the worst of them!</verse>
				<verse number="16">But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now to the eternal king, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I put this charge before you, Timothy my child, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight.</verse>
				<verse number="19">To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanks be offered on behalf of all people,</verse>
				<verse number="2">even for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Such prayer for all is good and welcomed before God our Savior,</verse>
				<verse number="4">since he wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For there is one God and one intermediary between God and humanity, Christ Jesus, himself human,</verse>
				<verse number="6">who gave himself as a ransom for all, revealing God’s purpose at his appointed time.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle — I am telling the truth; I am not lying — and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So I want the men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without anger or dispute.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Likewise the women are to dress in suitable apparel, with modesty and self-control. Their adornment must not be with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">A woman must learn quietly with all submissiveness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man. She must remain quiet.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For Adam was formed first and then Eve.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was fully deceived, fell into transgression.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But she will be delivered through childbearing, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">This saying is trustworthy: “If someone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">The overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, an able teacher,</verse>
				<verse number="3">not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?</verse>
				<verse number="6">He must not be a recent convert or he may become arrogant and fall into the punishment that the devil will exact.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he must be well thought of by those outside the faith, so that he may not fall into disgrace and be caught by the devil’s trap.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Deacons likewise must be dignified, not two-faced, not given to excessive drinking, not greedy for gain,</verse>
				<verse number="9">holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And these also must be tested first and then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Likewise also their wives must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in every respect.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Deacons must be husbands of one wife and good managers of their children and their own households.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you</verse>
				<verse number="15">in case I am delayed, to let you know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, because it is the church of the living God, the support and bulwark of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And we all agree, our religion contains amazing revelation: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves with deceiving spirits and demonic teachings,</verse>
				<verse number="2">influenced by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For every creation of God is good and no food is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="6">By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, having nourished yourself on the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But reject those myths fit only for the godless and gullible, and train yourself for godliness.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For “physical exercise has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way. It holds promise for the present life and for the life to come.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.</verse>
				<verse number="10">In fact this is why we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Command and teach these things.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in your speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Do not neglect the spiritual gift you have, given to you and confirmed by prophetic words when the elders laid hands on you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that everyone will see your progress.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Be conscientious about how you live and what you teach. Persevere in this, because by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Do not address an older man harshly but appeal to him as a father. Speak to younger men as brothers,</verse>
				<verse number="2">older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters — with complete purity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Honor widows who are truly in need.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to fulfill their duty toward their own household and so repay their parents what is owed them. For this is what pleases God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But the widow who is truly in need, and completely on her own, has set her hope on God and continues in her pleas and prayers night and day.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But the one who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Reinforce these commands, so that they will be beyond reproach.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if someone does not provide for his own, especially his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
				<verse number="9">No widow should be put on the list unless she is at least sixty years old, was the wife of one husband,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and has a reputation for good works: as one who has raised children, practiced hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, helped those in distress — as one who has exhibited all kinds of good works.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But do not accept younger widows on the list, because their passions may lead them away from Christ and they will desire to marry,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and so incur judgment for breaking their former pledge.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And besides that, going around from house to house they learn to be lazy, and they are not only lazy, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things they should not.</verse>
				<verse number="14">So I want younger women to marry, raise children, and manage a household, in order to give the adversary no opportunity to vilify us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For some have already wandered away to follow Satan.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If a believing woman has widows in her family, let her help them. The church should not be burdened, so that it may help the widows who are truly in need.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Elders who provide effective leadership must be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For the scripture says, “ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and, “The worker deserves his pay.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it can be confirmed by two or three witnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Those guilty of sin must be rebuked before all, as a warning to the rest.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, I solemnly charge you to carry out these commands without prejudice or favoritism of any kind.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Do not lay hands on anyone hastily and so identify with the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
				<verse number="23">(Stop drinking just water, but use a little wine for your digestion and your frequent illnesses.)</verse>
				<verse number="24">The sins of some people are obvious, going before them into judgment, but for others, they show up later.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Similarly good works are also obvious, and the ones that are not cannot remain hidden.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Those who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters as deserving of full respect. This will prevent the name of God and Christian teaching from being discredited.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But those who have believing masters must not show them less respect because they are brothers. Instead they are to serve all the more, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dearly loved. Teach them and exhort them about these things.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If someone spreads false teachings and does not agree with sound words (that is, those of our Lord Jesus Christ) and with the teaching that accords with godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="4">he is conceited and understands nothing, but has an unhealthy interest in controversies and verbal disputes. This gives rise to envy, dissension, slanders, evil suspicions,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and constant bickering by people corrupted in their minds and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a way of making a profit.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now godliness combined with contentment brings great profit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For we have brought nothing into this world and so we cannot take a single thing out either.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if we have food and shelter, we will be satisfied with that.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Those who long to be rich, however, stumble into temptation and a trap and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the love of money is the root of all evils. Some people in reaching for it have strayed from the faith and stabbed themselves with many pains.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But you, as a person dedicated to God, keep away from all that. Instead pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Compete well for the faith and lay hold of that eternal life you were called for and made your good confession for in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I charge you before God who gives life to all things and Christ Jesus who made his good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
				<verse number="14">to obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ</verse>
				<verse number="15">— whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will reveal at the right time.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He alone possesses immortality and lives in unapproachable light, whom no human has ever seen or is able to see. To him be honor and eternal power! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Command those who are rich in this world’s goods not to be haughty or to set their hope on riches, which are uncertain, but on God who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Tell them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous givers, sharing with others.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In this way they will save up a treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the future and so lay hold of what is truly life.</verse>
				<verse number="20">O Timothy, protect what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane chatter and absurdities of so-called “knowledge.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">By professing it, some have strayed from the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
			</chapter>

		<book number="55">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to further the promise of life in Christ Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="3">I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I remember you in my prayers as I do constantly night and day.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As I remember your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I recall your sincere faith that was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Because of this I remind you to rekindle God’s gift that you possess through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For God did not give us a Spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but by God’s power accept your share of suffering for the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He is the one who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not based on our works but on his own purpose and grace, granted to us in Christ Jesus before time began,</verse>
				<verse number="10">but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel!</verse>
				<verse number="11">For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Hold to the standard of sound words that you heard from me and do so with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Protect that good thing entrusted to you, through the Holy Spirit who lives within us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You know that everyone in the province of Asia deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
				<verse number="16">May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well all the ways he served me in Ephesus.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And entrust what you heard me say in the presence of many others as witnesses to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="4">No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David; such is my gospel,</verse>
				<verse number="9">for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but God’s message is not imprisoned!</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory.</verse>
				<verse number="11">This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we will also live with him.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words. This is of no benefit; it just brings ruin on those who listen.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But avoid profane chatter, because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness,</verse>
				<verse number="17">and their message will spread its infection like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining some people’s faith.</verse>
				<verse number="19">However, God’s solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: “ The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also ones made of wood and of clay, and some are for honorable use, but others for ignoble use.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, because you know they breed infighting.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And the Lord’s slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient,</verse>
				<verse number="25">correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth</verse>
				<verse number="26">and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive to do his will.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
				<verse number="3">unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good,</verse>
				<verse number="4">treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Such women are always seeking instruction, yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="8">And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people — who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith — also oppose the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You, however, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,</verse>
				<verse number="11">as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="14">You, however, must continue in the things you have learned and are confident about. You know who taught you</verse>
				<verse number="15">and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="17">that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Preach the message, be ready whether it is convenient or not, reprove, rebuke, exhort with complete patience and instruction.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear new things.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You, however, be self-controlled in all things, endure hardship, do an evangelist’s work, fulfill your ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for me to depart is at hand.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have competed well; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith!</verse>
				<verse number="8">Finally the crown of righteousness is reserved for me. The Lord, the righteous Judge, will award it to me in that day — and not to me only, but also to all who have set their affection on his appearing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Make every effort to come to me soon.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For Demas deserted me, since he loved the present age, and he went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is a great help to me in ministry.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Now I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
				<verse number="13">When you come, bring with you the cloak I left in Troas with Carpas and the scrolls, especially the parchments.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him in keeping with his deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You be on guard against him too, because he vehemently opposed our words.</verse>
				<verse number="16">At my first defense no one appeared in my support; instead they all deserted me — may they not be held accountable for it.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed for all the Gentiles to hear. And so I was delivered from the lion’s mouth!</verse>
				<verse number="18">The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever! Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Erastus stayed in Corinth. Trophimus I left ill in Miletus.</verse>

				<verse number="1">From Paul, a slave of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, to further the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that is in keeping with godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the ages began.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But now in his own time he has made his message evident through the preaching I was entrusted with according to the command of God our Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="4">To Titus, my genuine son in a common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior!</verse>
				<verse number="5">The reason I left you in Crete was to set in order the remaining matters and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who cannot be charged with dissipation or rebellion.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the overseer must be blameless as one entrusted with God’s work, not arrogant, not prone to anger, not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for gain.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Instead he must be hospitable, devoted to what is good, sensible, upright, devout, and self-controlled.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He must hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught, so that he will be able to give exhortation in such healthy teaching and correct those who speak against it.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For there are many rebellious people, idle talkers, and deceivers, especially those with Jewish connections,</verse>
				<verse number="11">who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught.</verse>
				<verse number="12">A certain one of them, in fact, one of their own prophets, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Such testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply that they may be healthy in the faith</verse>
				<verse number="14">and not pay attention to Jewish myths and commands of people who reject the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">All is pure to those who are pure. But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They profess to know God but with their deeds they deny him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">But as for you, communicate the behavior that goes with sound teaching.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
				<verse number="5">to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of God may not be discredited.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled,</verse>
				<verse number="7">showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way. In your teaching show integrity, dignity,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and a sound message that cannot be criticized, so that any opponent will be at a loss, because he has nothing evil to say about us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in everything, to do what is wanted and not talk back,</verse>
				<verse number="10">not pilfering, but showing all good faith, in order to bring credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,</verse>
				<verse number="13">as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good.</verse>
				<verse number="15">So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority. Don’t let anyone look down on you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work.</verse>
				<verse number="2">They must not slander anyone, but be peaceable, gentle, showing complete courtesy to all people.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we too were once foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to various passions and desires, spending our lives in evil and envy, hateful and hating one another.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared,</verse>
				<verse number="5">he saved us not by works of righteousness that we have done but on the basis of his mercy, through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="6">whom he poured out on us in full measure through Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="7">And so, since we have been justified by his grace, we become heirs with the confident expectation of eternal life.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">This saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on such truths, so that those who have placed their faith in God may be intent on engaging in good works. These things are good and beneficial for all people.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law, because they are useless and empty.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Reject a divisive person after one or two warnings.</verse>
				<verse number="11">You know that such a person is twisted by sin and is conscious of it himself.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Make every effort to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; make sure they have what they need.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Here is another way that our people can learn to engage in good works to meet pressing needs and so not be unfruitful.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Everyone with me greets you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>

				<verse number="1">From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
				<verse number="4">I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</verse>
				<verse number="5">because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="7">I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
				<verse number="8">So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper,</verse>
				<verse number="9">I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love — I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus —</verse>
				<verse number="10">I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus,</verse>
				<verse number="11">who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.</verse>
				<verse number="14">However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,</verse>
				<verse number="16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do.</verse>
				<verse number="22">At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too.</verse>
				<verse number="25">May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>

		<book number="58">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">After God spoke long ago in various portions and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets,</verse>
				<verse number="2">in these last days he has spoken to us in a son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, and he sustains all things by his powerful word, and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For to which of the angels did God ever say, “ You are my son! Today I have fathered you ”? And in another place he says, “ I will be his father and he will be my son.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “ Let all the angels of God worship him! ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">And he says of the angels, “ He makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire,”</verse>
				<verse number="8">but of the Son he says, “ Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. So God, your God, has anointed you over your companions with the oil of rejoicing.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">And, “ You founded the earth in the beginning, Lord, and the heavens are the works of your hands.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They will perish, but you continue. And they will all grow old like a garment,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and like a robe you will fold them up and like a garment they will be changed, but you are the same and your years will never run out.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">But to which of the angels has he ever said, “ Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ”?</verse>
				<verse number="14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation?</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if the message spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty,</verse>
				<verse number="3">how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</verse>
				<verse number="4">while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For he did not put the world to come, about which we are speaking, under the control of angels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Instead someone testified somewhere: “ What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him?</verse>
				<verse number="7">You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You crowned him with glory and honor.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You put all things under his control.” For when he put all things under his control, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see all things under his control,</verse>
				<verse number="9">but we see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God’s grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,</verse>
				<verse number="12">saying, “ I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Again he says, “I will be confident in him,” and again, “ Here I am, with the children God has given me.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in their humanity, so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death (that is, the devil),</verse>
				<verse number="15">and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess,</verse>
				<verse number="2">who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself!</verse>
				<verse number="4">For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “ Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!</verse>
				<verse number="8">“ Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ There your fathers tested me and tried me, and they saw my works for forty years.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said, ‘ Their hearts are always wandering and they have not known my ways.’</verse>
				<verse number="11">“ As I swore in my anger, ‘ They will never enter my rest! ’”</verse>
				<verse number="12">See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end.</verse>
				<verse number="15">As it says, “ Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership?</verse>
				<verse number="17">And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
				<verse number="18">And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?</verse>
				<verse number="19">So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Therefore we must be wary that, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, none of you may seem to have come short of it.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in with those who heard it in faith.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “ As I swore in my anger, ‘ They will never enter my rest! ’” And yet God’s works were accomplished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</verse>
				<verse number="5">but to repeat the text cited earlier: “ They will never enter my rest! ”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So God again ordains a certain day, “Today,” speaking through David after so long a time, as in the words quoted before, “ O, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken afterward about another day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the one who enters God’s rest has also rested from his works, just as God did from his own works.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.</verse>
				<verse number="13">And no creature is hidden from God, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">For every high priest is taken from among the people and appointed to represent them before God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring, since he also is subject to weakness,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and for this reason he is obligated to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And no one assumes this honor on his own initiative, but only when called to it by God, as in fact Aaron was.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest, but the one who glorified him was God, who said to him, “ You are my Son! Today I have fathered you,”</verse>
				<verse number="6">as also in another place God says, “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">During his earthly life Christ offered both requests and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And by being perfected in this way, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
				<verse number="10">and he was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
				<verse number="11">On this topic we have much to say and it is difficult to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For though you should in fact be teachers by this time, you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God’s utterances. You have gone back to needing milk, not solid food.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But solid food is for the mature, whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Therefore we must progress beyond the elementary instructions about Christ and move on to maturity, not laying this foundation again: repentance from dead works and faith in God,</verse>
				<verse number="2">teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And this is what we intend to do, if God permits.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="5">tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and then have committed apostasy, to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again and holding him up to contempt.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the ground that has soaked up the rain that frequently falls on it and yields useful vegetation for those who tend it receives a blessing from God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is useless and about to be cursed; its fate is to be burned.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But in your case, dear friends, even though we speak like this, we are convinced of better things relating to salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name, in having served and continuing to serve the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end,</verse>
				<verse number="12">so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,</verse>
				<verse number="14">saying, “ Surely I will bless you greatly and multiply your descendants abundantly.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">And so by persevering, Abraham inherited the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For people swear by something greater than themselves, and the oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute.</verse>
				<verse number="17">In the same way God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise that his purpose was unchangeable, and so he intervened with an oath,</verse>
				<verse number="18">so that we who have found refuge in him may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things, since it is impossible for God to lie.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain,</verse>
				<verse number="20">where Jesus our forerunner entered on our behalf, since he became a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Now this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">To him also Abraham apportioned a tithe of everything. His name first means king of righteousness, then king of Salem, that is, king of peace.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Without father, without mother, without genealogy, he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God, and he remains a priest for all time.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But see how great he must be, if Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of his plunder.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen, although they too are descendants of Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who possessed the promise.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive.</verse>
				<verse number="9">And it could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid a tithe through Abraham.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For he was still in his ancestor Abraham’s loins when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">So if perfection had in fact been possible through the Levitical priesthood — for on that basis the people received the law — what further need would there have been for another priest to arise, said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in Aaron’s order?</verse>
				<verse number="12">For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come as well.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever officiated at the altar.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,</verse>
				<verse number="16">who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For here is the testimony about him: “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">On the one hand a former command is set aside because it is weak and useless,</verse>
				<verse number="19">for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And since this was not done without a sworn affirmation — for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation,</verse>
				<verse number="21">but Jesus did so with a sworn affirmation by the one who said to him, “ The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘ You are a priest forever ’” —</verse>
				<verse number="22">accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And the others who became priests were numerous, because death prevented them from continuing in office,</verse>
				<verse number="24">but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever.</verse>
				<verse number="25">So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He has no need to do every day what those priests do, to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people, since he did this in offering himself once for all.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness, but the word of solemn affirmation that came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="2">a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, “ See that you make everything according to the design shown to you on the mountain.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But showing its fault, God says to them, “ Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</verse>
				<verse number="9">“ It will not be like the covenant that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them, says the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="10">“ For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts. And I will be their God and they will be my people.</verse>
				<verse number="11">“ And there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘ Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
				<verse number="12">“ For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer.”</verse>
				<verse number="13">When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Now the first covenant, in fact, had regulations for worship and its earthly sanctuary.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For a tent was prepared, the outer one, which contained the lampstand, the table, and the presentation of the loaves; this is called the holy place.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And after the second curtain there was a tent called the holy of holies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. In this ark were the golden urn containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And above the ark were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Now is not the time to speak of these things in detail.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So with these things prepared like this, the priests enter continually into the outer tent as they perform their duties.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent, and not without blood that he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the holy place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle was standing.</verse>
				<verse number="9">This was a symbol for the time then present, when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They served only for matters of food and drink and various washings; they are external regulations imposed until the new order came.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things to come. He passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and he entered once for all into the most holy place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood, and so he himself secured eternal redemption.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity,</verse>
				<verse number="14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And so he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance he has promised, since he died to set them free from the violations committed under the first covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be proven.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For a will takes effect only at death, since it carries no force while the one who made it is alive.</verse>
				<verse number="18">So even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
				<verse number="20">and said, “ This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to keep.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">And both the tabernacle and all the utensils of worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
				<verse number="23">So it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required better sacrifices than these.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands — the representation of the true sanctuary — but into heaven itself, and he appears now in God’s presence for us.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And he did not enter to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the sanctuary year after year with blood that is not his own,</verse>
				<verse number="26">for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
				<verse number="27">And just as people are appointed to die once, and then to face judgment,</verse>
				<verse number="28">so also, after Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many, to those who eagerly await him he will appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin?</verse>
				<verse number="3">But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So when he came into the world, he said, “ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in.</verse>
				<verse number="7">“ Then I said, ‘ Here I am: I have come — it is written of me in the scroll of the book — to do your will, O God.’”</verse>
				<verse number="8">When he says above, “ Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them” (which are offered according to the law),</verse>
				<verse number="9">then he says, “ Here I am: I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first to establish the second.</verse>
				<verse number="10">By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And every priest stands day after day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again — sacrifices that can never take away sins.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
				<verse number="13">where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying,</verse>
				<verse number="16">“ This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws on their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds,”</verse>
				<verse number="17">then he says, “ Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no longer.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
				<verse number="20">by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,</verse>
				<verse number="21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
				<verse number="22">let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings, because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works,</verse>
				<verse number="25">not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day drawing near.</verse>
				<verse number="26">For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us,</verse>
				<verse number="27">but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume God’s enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="29">How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for the Son of God, and profanes the blood of the covenant that made him holy, and insults the Spirit of grace?</verse>
				<verse number="30">For we know the one who said, “ Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” and again, “ The Lord will judge his people.”</verse>
				<verse number="31">It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
				<verse number="32">But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened.</verse>
				<verse number="33">At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</verse>
				<verse number="34">For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison, and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy, because you knew that you certainly had a better and lasting possession.</verse>
				<verse number="35">So do not throw away your confidence, because it has great reward.</verse>
				<verse number="36">For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For just a little longer and he who is coming will arrive and not delay.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But my righteous one will live by faith, and if he shrinks back, I take no pleasure in him.</verse>
				<verse number="39">But we are not among those who shrink back and thus perish, but are among those who have faith and preserve their souls.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For by it the people of old received God’s commendation.</verse>
				<verse number="3">By faith we understand that the worlds were set in order at God’s command, so that the visible has its origin in the invisible.</verse>
				<verse number="4">By faith Abel offered God a greater sacrifice than Cain, and through his faith he was commended as righteous, because God commended him for his offerings. And through his faith he still speaks, though he is dead.</verse>
				<verse number="5">By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, and he was not to be found because God took him up. For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">By faith Noah, when he was warned about things not yet seen, with reverent regard constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family. Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, and he went out without understanding where he was going.</verse>
				<verse number="9">By faith he lived as a foreigner in the promised land as though it were a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs of the same promise.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren and he was too old, he received the ability to procreate, because he regarded the one who had given the promise to be trustworthy.</verse>
				<verse number="12">So in fact children were fathered by one man — and this one as good as dead — like the number of stars in the sky and like the innumerable grains of sand on the seashore.</verse>
				<verse number="13">These all died in faith without receiving the things promised, but they saw them in the distance and welcomed them and acknowledged that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In fact, if they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But as it is, they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
				<verse number="17">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He had received the promises, yet he was ready to offer up his only son.</verse>
				<verse number="18">God had told him, “ Through Isaac descendants will carry on your name,”</verse>
				<verse number="19">and he reasoned that God could even raise him from the dead, and in a sense he received him back from there.</verse>
				<verse number="20">By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future.</verse>
				<verse number="21">By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped as he leaned on his staff.</verse>
				<verse number="22">By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his burial.</verse>
				<verse number="23">By faith, when Moses was born, his parents hid him for three months, because they saw the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</verse>
				<verse number="24">By faith, when he grew up, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</verse>
				<verse number="25">choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to enjoy sin’s fleeting pleasure.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He regarded abuse suffered for Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for his eyes were fixed on the reward.</verse>
				<verse number="27">By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king’s anger, for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible.</verse>
				<verse number="28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.</verse>
				<verse number="29">By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry ground, but when the Egyptians tried it, they were swallowed up.</verse>
				<verse number="30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell after the people marched around them for seven days.</verse>
				<verse number="31">By faith Rahab the prostitute escaped the destruction of the disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.</verse>
				<verse number="32">And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, gained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
				<verse number="34">quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength in weakness, became mighty in battle, put foreign armies to flight,</verse>
				<verse number="35">and women received back their dead raised to life. But others were tortured, not accepting release, to obtain resurrection to a better life.</verse>
				<verse number="36">And others experienced mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.</verse>
				<verse number="37">They were stoned, sawed apart, murdered with the sword; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins; they were destitute, afflicted, ill-treated</verse>
				<verse number="38">(the world was not worthy of them); they wandered in deserts and mountains and caves and openings in the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="39">And these all were commended for their faith, yet they did not receive what was promised.</verse>
				<verse number="40">For God had provided something better for us, so that they would be made perfect together with us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and run with endurance the race set out for us,</verse>
				<verse number="2">keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons? “ My son, do not scorn the Lord’s discipline or give up when he corrects you.</verse>
				<verse number="6">“ For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son he accepts.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Endure your suffering as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline?</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if you do not experience discipline, something all sons have shared in, then you are illegitimate and are not sons.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Besides, we have experienced discipline from our earthly fathers and we respected them; shall we not submit ourselves all the more to the Father of spirits and receive life?</verse>
				<verse number="10">For they disciplined us for a little while as seemed good to them, but he does so for our benefit, that we may share his holiness.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Now all discipline seems painful at the time, not joyful. But later it produces the fruit of peace and righteousness for those trained by it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, strengthen your listless hands and your weak knees,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but be healed.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, for without it no one will see the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="15">See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no one be like a bitter root springing up and causing trouble, and through him many become defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And see to it that no one becomes an immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, although he sought the blessing with tears.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For you have not come to something that can be touched, to a burning fire and darkness and gloom and a whirlwind</verse>
				<verse number="19">and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words such that those who heard begged to hear no more.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For they could not bear what was commanded: “ If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”</verse>
				<verse number="21">In fact, the scene was so terrifying that Moses said, “ I shudder with fear.”</verse>
				<verse number="22">But you have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the assembly</verse>
				<verse number="23">and congregation of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous, who have been made perfect,</verse>
				<verse number="24">and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks of something better than Abel’s does.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Take care not to refuse the one who is speaking! For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less shall we, if we reject the one who warns from heaven?</verse>
				<verse number="26">Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “ I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven too.”</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now this phrase “ once more ” indicates the removal of what is shaken, that is, of created things, so that what is unshaken may remain.</verse>
				<verse number="28">So since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us give thanks, and through this let us offer worship pleasing to God in devotion and awe.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For our God is indeed a devouring fire.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Brotherly love must continue.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Do not neglect hospitality, because through it some have entertained angels without knowing it.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them, and those ill-treated as though you too felt their torment.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Marriage must be honored among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled, for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Your conduct must be free from the love of money and you must be content with what you have, for he has said, “ I will never leave you and I will never abandon you.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">So we can say with confidence, “ The Lord is my helper, and I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? ”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Remember your leaders, who spoke God’s message to you; reflect on the outcome of their lives and imitate their faith.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever!</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings. For it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not ritual meals, which have never benefited those who participated in them.</verse>
				<verse number="10">We have an altar that those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat from.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the bodies of those animals whose blood the high priest brings into the sanctuary as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, to sanctify the people by his own blood, Jesus also suffered outside the camp.</verse>
				<verse number="13">We must go out to him, then, outside the camp, bearing the abuse he experienced.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, acknowledging his name.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls and will give an account for their work. Let them do this with joy and not with complaints, for this would be no advantage for you.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to conduct ourselves rightly in every respect.</verse>
				<verse number="19">I especially ask you to pray that I may be restored to you very soon.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now may the God of peace who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="21">equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever. Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, bear with my message of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you briefly.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You should know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Greetings to all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Grace be with you all.</verse>
			</chapter>
		</book>
		<book number="59">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From James, a slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad. Greetings!</verse>
				<verse number="2">My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials,</verse>
				<verse number="3">because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
				<verse number="4">And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord,</verse>
				<verse number="8">since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever. So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Happy is the one who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="17">All generous giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change.</verse>
				<verse number="18">By his sovereign plan he gave us birth through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="21">So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
				<verse number="22">But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves.</verse>
				<verse number="23">For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone who gazes at his own face in a mirror.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets what sort of person he was.</verse>
				<verse number="25">But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out — he will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
				<verse number="26">If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">My brothers and sisters, do not show prejudice if you possess faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For if someone comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring and fine clothing, and a poor person enters in filthy clothes,</verse>
				<verse number="3">do you pay attention to the one who is finely dressed and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and to the poor person, “You stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor”?</verse>
				<verse number="4">If so, have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives?</verse>
				<verse number="5">Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts?</verse>
				<verse number="7">Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to?</verse>
				<verse number="8">But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture, “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if you show prejudice, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For he who said, “ Do not commit adultery,” also said, “ Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a violator of the law.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy. But mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="14">What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can this kind of faith save him?</verse>
				<verse number="15">If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacks daily food,</verse>
				<verse number="16">and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and eat well,” but you do not give them what the body needs, what good is it?</verse>
				<verse number="17">So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works.</verse>
				<verse number="19">You believe that God is one; well and good. Even the demons believe that — and tremble with fear.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But would you like evidence, you empty fellow, that faith without works is useless?</verse>
				<verse number="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
				<verse number="22">You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works.</verse>
				<verse number="23">And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “ Now Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend.</verse>
				<verse number="24">You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.</verse>
				<verse number="25">And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way?</verse>
				<verse number="26">For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, because you know that we will be judged more strictly.</verse>
				<verse number="2">For we all stumble in many ways. If someone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect individual, able to control the entire body as well.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us, then we guide their entire bodies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Look at ships too: Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination directs.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So too the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it has great pretensions. Think how small a flame sets a huge forest ablaze.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And the tongue is a fire! The tongue represents the world of wrongdoing among the parts of our bodies. It pollutes the entire body and sets fire to the course of human existence — and is set on fire by hell.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is subdued and has been subdued by humankind.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But no human being can subdue the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
				<verse number="9">With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in God’s image.</verse>
				<verse number="10">From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters.</verse>
				<verse number="11">A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it?</verse>
				<verse number="12">Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a vine produce figs? Neither can a salt water spring produce fresh water.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, natural, demonic.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and not hypocritical.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And the fruit that consists of righteousness is planted in peace among those who make peace.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Where do the conflicts and where do the quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this, from your passions that battle inside you?</verse>
				<verse number="2">You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask;</verse>
				<verse number="3">you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God? So whoever decides to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says, “The spirit that God caused to live within us has an envious yearning”?</verse>
				<verse number="6">But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “ God opposes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters. He who speaks against a fellow believer or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge — the one who is able to save and destroy. On the other hand, who are you to judge your neighbor?</verse>
				<verse number="13">Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You ought to say instead, “If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Come now, you rich! Weep and cry aloud over the miseries that are coming on you.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Your riches have rotted and your clothing has become moth-eaten.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have hoarded treasure!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Look, the pay you have held back from the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You have lived indulgently and luxuriously on the earth. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You have condemned and murdered the righteous person, although he does not resist you.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So be patient, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s return. Think of how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient for it until it receives the early and late rains.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You also be patient and strengthen your hearts, for the Lord’s return is near.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do not grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be judged. See, the judge stands before the gates!</verse>
				<verse number="10">As an example of suffering and patience, brothers and sisters, take the prophets who spoke in the Lord’s name.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Think of how we regard as blessed those who have endured. You have heard of Job’s endurance and you have seen the Lord’s purpose, that the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. But let your “Yes” be yes and your “No” be no, so that you may not fall into judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone in good spirits? He should sing praises.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Is anyone among you ill? He should summon the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up — and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</verse>
				<verse number="16">So confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great effectiveness.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and there was no rain on the land for three years and six months!</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land sprouted with a harvest.</verse>
				<verse number="19">My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back,</verse>
				<verse number="20">he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from his wandering path will save that person’s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>

			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those temporarily residing abroad (in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, the province of Asia, and Bithynia) who are chosen</verse>
				<verse number="2">according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by being set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for sprinkling with Jesus Christ’s blood. May grace and peace be yours in full measure!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he gave us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
				<verse number="4">that is, into an inheritance imperishable, undefiled, and unfading. It is reserved in heaven for you,</verse>
				<verse number="5">who by God’s power are protected through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
				<verse number="6">This brings you great joy, although you may have to suffer for a short time in various trials.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Such trials show the proven character of your faith, which is much more valuable than gold — gold that is tested by fire, even though it is passing away — and will bring praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="8">You have not seen him, but you love him. You do not see him now but you believe in him, and so you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,</verse>
				<verse number="9">because you are attaining the goal of your faith — the salvation of your souls.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Concerning this salvation, the prophets who predicted the grace that would come to you searched and investigated carefully.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They probed into what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified beforehand about the sufferings appointed for Christ and his subsequent glory.</verse>
				<verse number="12">They were shown that they were serving not themselves but you, in regard to the things now announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven — things angels long to catch a glimpse of.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore, get your minds ready for action by being fully sober, and set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Like obedient children, do not comply with the evil urges you used to follow in your ignorance,</verse>
				<verse number="15">but, like the Holy One who called you, become holy yourselves in all of your conduct,</verse>
				<verse number="16">for it is written, “ You shall be holy, because I am holy.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And if you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one’s work, live out the time of your temporary residence here in reverence.</verse>
				<verse number="18">You know that from your empty way of life inherited from your ancestors you were ransomed — not by perishable things like silver or gold,</verse>
				<verse number="19">but by precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, namely Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="20">He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for your sake.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Through him you now trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">You have purified your souls by obeying the truth in order to show sincere mutual love. So love one another earnestly from a pure heart.</verse>
				<verse number="23">You have been born anew, not from perishable but from imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="24">For all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass; the grass withers and the flower falls off,</verse>
				<verse number="25">but the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And yearn like newborn infants for pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation,</verse>
				<verse number="3">if you have experienced the Lord’s kindness.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So as you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and priceless in God’s sight,</verse>
				<verse number="5">you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For it says in scripture, “ Look, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and priceless cornerstone, and whoever believes in him will never be put to shame.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">So you who believe see his value, but for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and a stumbling-stone and a rock to trip over. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of his own, so that you may proclaim the virtues of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You once were not a people, but now you are God’s people. You were shown no mercy, but now you have received mercy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul,</verse>
				<verse number="12">and maintain good conduct among the non-Christians, so that though they now malign you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God when he appears.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Be subject to every human institution for the Lord’s sake, whether to a king as supreme</verse>
				<verse number="14">or to governors as those he commissions to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good.</verse>
				<verse number="15">For God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Live as free people, not using your freedom as a pretext for evil, but as God’s slaves.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Honor all people, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the king.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are perverse.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For this finds God’s favor, if because of conscience toward God someone endures hardships in suffering unjustly.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps.</verse>
				<verse number="22">He committed no sin nor was deceit found in his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="23">When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness. By his wounds you were healed.</verse>
				<verse number="25">For you were going astray like sheep but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands. Then, even if some are disobedient to the word, they will be won over without a word by the way you live,</verse>
				<verse number="2">when they see your pure and reverent conduct.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Let your beauty not be external — the braiding of hair and wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes —</verse>
				<verse number="4">but the inner person of the heart, the lasting beauty of a gentle and tranquil spirit, which is precious in God’s sight.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For in the same way the holy women who hoped in God long ago adorned themselves by being subject to their husbands,</verse>
				<verse number="6">like Sarah who obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You become her children when you do what is good and have no fear in doing so.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners and show them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life. In this way nothing will hinder your prayers.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, affectionate, compassionate, and humble.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead bless others because you were called to inherit a blessing.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For the one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from uttering deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And he must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer. But the Lord’s face is against those who do evil.</verse>
				<verse number="13">For who is going to harm you if you are devoted to what is good?</verse>
				<verse number="14">But in fact, if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. But do not be terrified of them or be shaken.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts and always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks about the hope you possess.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yet do it with courtesy and respect, keeping a good conscience, so that those who slander your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame when they accuse you.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For it is better to suffer for doing good, if God wills it, than for doing evil.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Because Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring you to God, by being put to death in the flesh but by being made alive in the spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="19">In it he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
				<verse number="20">after they were disobedient long ago when God patiently waited in the days of Noah as an ark was being constructed. In the ark a few, that is eight souls, were delivered through water.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And this prefigured baptism, which now saves you — not the washing off of physical dirt but the pledge of a good conscience to God — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
				<verse number="22">who went into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels and authorities and powers subject to him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">So, since Christ suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same attitude, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin,</verse>
				<verse number="2">in that he spends the rest of his time on earth concerned about the will of God and not human desires.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to do what the non-Christians desire. You lived then in debauchery, evil desires, drunkenness, carousing, drinking bouts, and wanton idolatries.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So they are astonished when you do not rush with them into the same flood of wickedness, and they vilify you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They will face a reckoning before Jesus Christ who stands ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now it was for this very purpose that the gospel was preached to those who are now dead, so that though they were judged in the flesh by human standards they may live spiritually by God’s standards.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the culmination of all things is near. So be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Above all keep your love for one another fervent, because love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Show hospitality to one another without complaining.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Whoever speaks, let it be with God’s words. Whoever serves, do so with the strength that God supplies, so that in everything God will be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Dear friends, do not be astonished that a trial by fire is occurring among you, as though something strange were happening to you.</verse>
				<verse number="13">But rejoice in the degree that you have shared in the sufferings of Christ, so that when his glory is revealed you may also rejoice and be glad.</verse>
				<verse number="14">If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory, who is the Spirit of God, rests on you.</verse>
				<verse number="15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or criminal or as a troublemaker.</verse>
				<verse number="16">But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear such a name.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For it is time for judgment to begin, starting with the house of God. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</verse>
				<verse number="18">And if the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the ungodly and sinners?</verse>
				<verse number="19">So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">So as your fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings and as one who shares in the glory that will be revealed, I urge the elders among you:</verse>
				<verse number="2">Give a shepherd’s care to God’s flock among you, exercising oversight not merely as a duty but willingly under God’s direction, not for shameful profit but eagerly.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And do not lord it over those entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that never fades away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">In the same way, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
				<verse number="6">And God will exalt you in due time, if you humble yourselves under his mighty hand</verse>
				<verse number="7">by casting all your cares on him because he cares for you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Be sober and alert. Your enemy the devil, like a roaring lion, is on the prowl looking for someone to devour.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Resist him, strong in your faith, because you know that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are enduring the same kinds of suffering.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And, after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">To him belongs the power forever. Amen.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Through Silvanus, whom I know to be a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, in order to encourage you and testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you, and so does Mark, my son.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</verse>

		<book number="61">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">From Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, have been granted a faith just as precious as ours.</verse>
				<verse number="2">May grace and peace be lavished on you as you grow in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!</verse>
				<verse number="3">I can pray this because his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Through these things he has bestowed on us his precious and most magnificent promises, so that by means of what was promised you may become partakers of the divine nature, after escaping the worldly corruption that is produced by evil desire.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith excellence, to excellence, knowledge;</verse>
				<verse number="6">to knowledge, self-control; to self-control, perseverance; to perseverance, godliness;</verse>
				<verse number="7">to godliness, brotherly affection; to brotherly affection, unselfish love.</verse>
				<verse number="8">For if these things are really yours and are continually increasing, they will keep you from becoming ineffective and unproductive in your pursuit of knowing our Lord Jesus Christ more intimately.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But concerning the one who lacks such things — he is blind. That is to say, he is nearsighted, since he has forgotten about the cleansing of his past sins.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to be sure of your calling and election. For by doing this you will never stumble into sin.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For thus an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be richly provided for you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore, I intend to remind you constantly of these things even though you know them and are well established in the truth that you now have.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Indeed, as long as I am in this tabernacle, I consider it right to stir you up by way of a reminder,</verse>
				<verse number="14">since I know that my tabernacle will soon be removed, because our Lord Jesus Christ revealed this to me.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Indeed, I will also make every effort that, after my departure, you have a testimony of these things.</verse>
				<verse number="16">For we did not follow cleverly concocted fables when we made known to you the power and return of our Lord Jesus Christ; no, we were eyewitnesses of his grandeur.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory: “This is my dear Son, in whom I am delighted.”</verse>
				<verse number="18">When this voice was conveyed from heaven, we ourselves heard it, for we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Moreover, we possess the prophetic word as an altogether reliable thing. You do well if you pay attention to this as you would to a light shining in a murky place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Above all, you do well if you recognize this: No prophecy of scripture ever comes about by the prophet’s own imagination,</verse>
				<verse number="21">for no prophecy was ever borne of human impulse; rather, men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And many will follow their debauched lifestyles. Because of these false teachers, the way of truth will be slandered.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation pronounced long ago is not sitting idly by; their destruction is not asleep.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but threw them into hell and locked them up in chains in utter darkness, to be kept until the judgment,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and if he did not spare the ancient world, but did protect Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when God brought a flood on an ungodly world,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and if he turned to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when he condemned them to destruction, having appointed them to serve as an example to future generations of the ungodly,</verse>
				<verse number="7">and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man in anguish over the debauched lifestyle of lawless men,</verse>
				<verse number="8">(for while he lived among them day after day, that righteous man was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard )</verse>
				<verse number="9">— if so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials, and to reserve the unrighteous for punishment at the day of judgment,</verse>
				<verse number="10">especially those who indulge their fleshly desires and who despise authority. Brazen and insolent, they are not afraid to insult the glorious ones,</verse>
				<verse number="11">yet even angels, who are much more powerful, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
				<verse number="12">But these men, like irrational animals — creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed — do not understand whom they are insulting, and consequently in their destruction they will be destroyed,</verse>
				<verse number="13">suffering harm as the wages for their harmful ways. By considering it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight, they are stains and blemishes, indulging in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Their eyes, full of adultery, never stop sinning; they entice unstable people. They have trained their hearts for greed, these cursed children!</verse>
				<verse number="15">By forsaking the right path they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
				<verse number="16">yet was rebuked for his own transgression (a dumb donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness).</verse>
				<verse number="17">These men are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm, for whom the utter depths of darkness have been reserved.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For by speaking high-sounding but empty words they are able to entice, with fleshly desires and with debauchery, people who have just escaped from those who reside in error.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Although these false teachers promise such people freedom, they themselves are enslaved to immorality. For whatever a person succumbs to, to that he is enslaved.</verse>
				<verse number="20">For if after they have escaped the filthy things of the world through the rich knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again get entangled in them and succumb to them, their last state has become worse for them than their first.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than, having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.</verse>
				<verse number="22">They are illustrations of this true proverb: “ A dog returns to its own vomit,” and “A sow, after washing herself, wallows in the mire.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Dear friends, this is already the second letter I have written you, in which I am trying to stir up your pure mind by way of reminder:</verse>
				<verse number="2">I want you to recall both the predictions foretold by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Above all, understand this: In the last days blatant scoffers will come, being propelled by their own evil urges</verse>
				<verse number="4">and saying, “Where is his promised return? For ever since our ancestors died, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">For they deliberately suppress this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Through these things the world existing at that time was destroyed when it was deluged with water.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire, by being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice, that a single day is like a thousand years with the Lord and a thousand years are like a single day.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some regard slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he does not wish for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</verse>
				<verse number="10">But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; when it comes, the heavens will disappear with a horrific noise, and the celestial bodies will melt away in a blaze, and the earth and every deed done on it will be laid bare.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Since all these things are to melt away in this manner, what sort of people must we be, conducting our lives in holiness and godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="12">while waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God? Because of this day, the heavens will be burned up and dissolve, and the celestial bodies will melt away in a blaze!</verse>
				<verse number="13">But, according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness truly resides.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Therefore, dear friends, since you are waiting for these things, strive to be found at peace, without spot or blemish, when you come into his presence.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom given to him,</verse>
				<verse number="16">speaking of these things in all his letters. Some things in these letters are hard to understand, things the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they also do to the rest of the scriptures.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard that you do not get led astray by the error of these unprincipled men and fall from your firm grasp on the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="18">But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the honor both now and on that eternal day.</verse>

				<verse number="1">This is what we proclaim to you: what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and our hands have touched (concerning the word of life —</verse>
				<verse number="2">and the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and announce to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us).</verse>
				<verse number="3">What we have seen and heard we announce to you too, so that you may have fellowship with us (and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ).</verse>
				<verse number="4">Thus we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.</verse>
				<verse number="6">If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
				<verse number="8">If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">(My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. ) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous One,</verse>
				<verse number="2">and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Now by this we know that we have come to know God: if we keep his commandments.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The one who says “I have come to know God” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person.</verse>
				<verse number="5">But whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The one who says he resides in God ought himself to walk just as Jesus walked.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have already heard.</verse>
				<verse number="8">On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The one who says he is in the light but still hates his fellow Christian is still in the darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The one who loves his fellow Christian resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But the one who hates his fellow Christian is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I am writing to you, little children, that your sins have been forgiven because of his name.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am writing to you, fathers, that you have known him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, that you have conquered the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="14">I have written to you, children, that you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, that you have known him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, that you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</verse>
				<verse number="16">because all that is in the world (the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance produced by material possessions) is not from the Father, but is from the world.</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the world is passing away with all its desires, but the person who does the will of God remains forever.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Children, it is the last hour, and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. We know from this that it is the last hour.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us, because if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they went out from us to demonstrate that all of them do not belong to us.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Nevertheless you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I have not written to you that you do not know the truth, but that you do know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Who is the liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the antichrist: the person who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. The person who confesses the Son has the Father also.</verse>
				<verse number="24">As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Now this is the promise that he himself made to us: eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="26">These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you.</verse>
				<verse number="27">Now as for you, the anointing that you received from him resides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, it is true and is not a lie. Just as it has taught you, you reside in him.</verse>
				<verse number="28">And now, little children, remain in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from him in shame when he comes back.</verse>
				<verse number="29">If you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by him.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">(See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called God’s children — and indeed we are! For this reason the world does not know us: because it did not know him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever it is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And everyone who has this hope focused on him purifies himself, just as Jesus is pure).</verse>
				<verse number="4">Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; indeed, sin is lawlessness.</verse>
				<verse number="5">And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Everyone who resides in him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God’s seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness — the one who does not love his fellow Christian — is not of God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For this is the gospel message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another,</verse>
				<verse number="12">not like Cain who was of the evil one and brutally murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, but his brother’s were righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Therefore do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.</verse>
				<verse number="14">We know that we have crossed over from death to life because we love our fellow Christians. The one who does not love remains in death.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Everyone who hates his fellow Christian is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">We have come to know love by this: that Jesus laid down his life for us; thus we ought to lay down our lives for our fellow Christians.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But whoever has the world’s possessions and sees his fellow Christian in need and shuts off his compassion against him, how can the love of God reside in such a person?</verse>
				<verse number="18">Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And by this we will know that we are of the truth and will convince our conscience in his presence,</verse>
				<verse number="20">that if our conscience condemns us, that God is greater than our conscience and knows all things.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God,</verse>
				<verse number="22">and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Now this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he gave us the commandment.</verse>
				<verse number="24">And the person who keeps his commandments resides in God, and God in him. Now by this we know that God resides in us: by the Spirit he has given us.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
				<verse number="2">By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh is from God,</verse>
				<verse number="3">but every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now is already in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You are from God, little children, and have conquered them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.</verse>
				<verse number="5">They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world’s perspective and the world listens to them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We are from God; the person who knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been fathered by God and knows God.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
				<verse number="9">By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Dear friends, if God so loved us, then we also ought to love one another.</verse>
				<verse number="12">No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us.</verse>
				<verse number="13">By this we know that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God resides in him and he in God.</verse>
				<verse number="16">And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has in us. God is love, and the one who resides in love resides in God, and God resides in him.</verse>
				<verse number="17">By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as Jesus is, so also are we in this world.</verse>
				<verse number="18">There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears punishment has not been perfected in love.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We love because he loved us first.</verse>
				<verse number="20">If anyone says “I love God” and yet hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar, because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And the commandment we have from him is this: that the one who loves God should love his fellow Christian too.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God, and everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him.</verse>
				<verse number="2">By this we know that we love the children of God: whenever we love God and obey his commandments.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments do not weigh us down,</verse>
				<verse number="4">because everyone who has been fathered by God conquers the world. This is the conquering power that has conquered the world: our faith.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
				<verse number="6">Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood — not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For there are three that testify,</verse>
				<verse number="8">the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are in agreement.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son.</verse>
				<verse number="10">(The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)</verse>
				<verse number="11">And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The one who has the Son has this eternal life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have this eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="13">I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="14">And this is the confidence that we have before him: that whenever we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.</verse>
				<verse number="15">And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, then we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.</verse>
				<verse number="16">If anyone sees his fellow Christian committing a sin not resulting in death, he should ask, and God will grant life to the person who commits a sin not resulting in death. There is a sin resulting in death. I do not say that he should ask about that.</verse>
				<verse number="17">All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not resulting in death.</verse>
				<verse number="18">We know that everyone fathered by God does not sin, but God protects the one he has fathered, and the evil one cannot touch him.</verse>
				<verse number="19">We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.</verse>
				<verse number="20">And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight to know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life.</verse>

				<verse number="5">Dear friend, you demonstrate faithfulness by whatever you do for the brothers (even though they are strangers).</verse>

				<verse number="2">May mercy, peace, and love be lavished on you!</verse>
				<verse number="3">Dear friends, although I have been eager to write to you about our common salvation, I now feel compelled instead to write to encourage you to contend earnestly for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For certain men have secretly slipped in among you — men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe — ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now I desire to remind you (even though you have been fully informed of these facts once for all ) that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You also know that the angels who did not keep within their proper domain but abandoned their own place of residence, he has kept in eternal chains in utter darkness, locked up for the judgment of the great Day.</verse>
				<verse number="7">So also Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns, since they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire in a way similar to these angels, are now displayed as an example by suffering the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yet these men, as a result of their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and insult the glorious ones.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But even when Michael the archangel was arguing with the devil and debating with him concerning Moses’ body, he did not dare to bring a slanderous judgment, but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">But these men do not understand the things they slander, and they are being destroyed by the very things that, like irrational animals, they instinctively comprehend.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Woe to them! For they have traveled down Cain’s path, and because of greed have abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error; hence, they will certainly perish in Korah’s rebellion.</verse>
				<verse number="12">These men are dangerous reefs at your love feasts, feasting without reverence, feeding only themselves. They are waterless clouds, carried along by the winds; autumn trees without fruit — twice dead, uprooted;</verse>
				<verse number="13">wild sea waves, spewing out the foam of their shame; wayward stars for whom the utter depths of eternal darkness have been reserved.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Now Enoch, the seventh in descent beginning with Adam, even prophesied of them, saying, “Look! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones,</verse>
				<verse number="15">to execute judgment on all, and to convict every person of all their thoroughly ungodly deeds that they have committed, and of all the harsh words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">These people are grumblers and fault-finders who go wherever their desires lead them, and they give bombastic speeches, enchanting folks for their own gain.</verse>
				<verse number="17">But you, dear friends — recall the predictions foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
				<verse number="18">For they said to you, “In the end time there will come scoffers, propelled by their own ungodly desires.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">These people are divisive, worldly, devoid of the Spirit.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith, by praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="21">maintain yourselves in the love of God, while anticipating the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="22">And have mercy on those who waver;</verse>
				<verse number="23">save others by snatching them out of the fire; have mercy on others, coupled with a fear of God, hating even the clothes stained by the flesh.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling, and to cause you to stand, rejoicing, without blemish before his glorious presence,</verse>

				<verse number="3">Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy aloud, and blessed are those who hear and obey the things written in it, because the time is near!</verse>
				<verse number="4">From John, to the seven churches that are in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from “he who is,” and who was, and who is still to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,</verse>

				<verse number="12">I turned to see whose voice was speaking to me, and when I did so, I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
				<verse number="13">and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man. He was dressed in a robe extending down to his feet and he wore a wide golden belt around his chest.</verse>
				<verse number="14">His head and hair were as white as wool, even as white as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame.</verse>
				<verse number="15">His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword extended out of his mouth. His face shone like the sun shining at full strength.</verse>
				<verse number="17">When I saw him I fell down at his feet as though I were dead, but he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last,</verse>
				<verse number="18">and the one who lives! I was dead, but look, now I am alive — forever and ever — and I hold the keys of death and of Hades!</verse>
				<verse number="19">Therefore write what you saw, what is, and what will be after these things.</verse>

				<verse number="2">‘I know your works as well as your labor and steadfast endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil. You have even put to the test those who refer to themselves as apostles (but are not), and have discovered that they are false.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I am also aware that you have persisted steadfastly, endured much for the sake of my name, and have not grown weary.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But I have this against you: You have departed from your first love!</verse>
				<verse number="5">Therefore, remember from what high state you have fallen and repent! Do the deeds you did at the first; if not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place — that is, if you do not repent.</verse>
				<verse number="6">But you do have this going for you: You hate what the Nicolaitans practice — practices I also hate.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will permit him to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.’</verse>
				<verse number="8">“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who is the first and the last, the one who was dead, but came to life:</verse>
				<verse number="9">‘I know the distress you are suffering and your poverty (but you are rich). I also know the slander against you by those who call themselves Jews and really are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. The devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison so you may be tested, and you will experience suffering for ten days. Remain faithful even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown that is life itself.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will in no way be harmed by the second death.’</verse>
				<verse number="12">“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who has the sharp double-edged sword:</verse>
				<verse number="13">‘I know where you live — where Satan’s throne is. Yet you continue to cling to my name and you have not denied your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed in your city where Satan lives.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But I have a few things against you: You have some people there who follow the teaching of Balaam, who instructed Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality.</verse>
				<verse number="15">In the same way, there are also some among you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Therefore, repent! If not, I will come against you quickly and make war against those people with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give him some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on that stone will be written a new name that no one can understand except the one who receives it.’</verse>
				<verse number="18">“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the Son of God, the one who has eyes like a fiery flame and whose feet are like polished bronze:</verse>
				<verse number="19">‘I know your deeds: your love, faith, service, and steadfast endurance. In fact, your more recent deeds are greater than your earlier ones.</verse>
				<verse number="20">But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and by her teaching deceives my servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I have given her time to repent, but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Look! I am throwing her onto a bed of violent illness, and those who commit adultery with her into terrible suffering, unless they repent of her deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Furthermore, I will strike her followers with a deadly disease, and then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will repay each one of you what your deeds deserve.</verse>
				<verse number="24">But to the rest of you in Thyatira, all who do not hold to this teaching (who have not learned the so-called “deep secrets of Satan”), to you I say: I do not put any additional burden on you.</verse>
				<verse number="25">However, hold on to what you have until I come.</verse>
				<verse number="26">And to the one who conquers and who continues in my deeds until the end, I will give him authority over the nations —</verse>
				<verse number="27">he will rule them with an iron rod and like clay jars he will break them to pieces,</verse>
				<verse number="28">just as I have received the right to rule from my Father — and I will give him the morning star.</verse>
				<verse number="29">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">“To the angel of the church in Sardis write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: ‘I know your deeds, that you have a reputation that you are alive, but in reality you are dead.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Wake up then, and strengthen what remains that was about to die, because I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Therefore, remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will never know at what hour I will come against you.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But you have a few individuals in Sardis who have not stained their clothes, and they will walk with me dressed in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The one who conquers will be dressed like them in white clothing, and I will never erase his name from the book of life, but will declare his name before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
				<verse number="7">“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the Holy One, the True One, who holds the key of David, who opens doors no one can shut, and shuts doors no one can open:</verse>
				<verse number="8">‘I know your deeds. (Look! I have put in front of you an open door that no one can shut.) I know that you have little strength, but you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Listen! I am going to make those people from the synagogue of Satan — who say they are Jews yet are not, but are lying — Look, I will make them come and bow down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Because you have kept my admonition to endure steadfastly, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come on the whole world to test those who live on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have so that no one can take away your crown.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The one who conquers I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never depart from it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God (the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from my God), and my new name as well.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
				<verse number="14">“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write the following: “This is the solemn pronouncement of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the originator of God’s creation:</verse>
				<verse number="15">‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either cold or hot!</verse>
				<verse number="16">So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth!</verse>
				<verse number="17">Because you say, “I am rich and have acquired great wealth, and need nothing,” but do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked,</verse>
				<verse number="18">take my advice and buy gold from me refined by fire so you can become rich! Buy from me white clothing so you can be clothed and your shameful nakedness will not be exposed, and buy eye salve to put on your eyes so you can see!</verse>
				<verse number="19">All those I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent!</verse>
				<verse number="20">Listen! I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come into his home and share a meal with him, and he with me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">I will grant the one who conquers permission to sit with me on my throne, just as I too conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
				<verse number="22">The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">After these things I looked, and there was a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said: “Come up here so that I can show you what must happen after these things.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">Immediately I was in the Spirit, and a throne was standing in heaven with someone seated on it!</verse>
				<verse number="3">And the one seated on it was like jasper and carnelian in appearance, and a rainbow looking like it was made of emerald encircled the throne.</verse>
				<verse number="4">In a circle around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on those thrones were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white clothing and had golden crowns on their heads.</verse>
				<verse number="5">From the throne came out flashes of lightning and roaring and crashes of thunder. Seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God, were burning in front of the throne</verse>
				<verse number="6">and in front of the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal. In the middle of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like an ox, the third creature had a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature looked like an eagle flying.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Each one of the four living creatures had six wings and was full of eyes all around and inside. They never rest day or night, saying: “ Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God, the All-Powerful, Who was and who is, and who is still to come!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</verse>
				<verse number="10">the twenty-four elders throw themselves to the ground before the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever, and they offer their crowns before his throne, saying:</verse>
				<verse number="11">“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, since you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and back and sealed with seven seals.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”</verse>
				<verse number="3">But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it.</verse>
				<verse number="4">So I began weeping bitterly because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered; thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders threw themselves to the ground before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense (which are the prayers of the saints).</verse>
				<verse number="9">They were singing a new song: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were killed, and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God persons from every tribe, language, people, and nation.</verse>
				<verse number="10">You have appointed them as a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels in a circle around the throne, as well as the living creatures and the elders. Their number was ten thousand times ten thousand — thousands times thousands —</verse>
				<verse number="12">all of whom were singing in a loud voice: “Worthy is the lamb who was killed to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and praise!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I heard every creature — in heaven, on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and all that is in them — singing: “To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be praise, honor, glory, and ruling power forever and ever!”</verse>
				<verse number="14">And the four living creatures were saying “Amen,” and the elders threw themselves to the ground and worshiped.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">I looked on when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a thunderous voice, “Come!”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So I looked, and here came a white horse! The one who rode it had a bow, and he was given a crown, and as a conqueror he rode out to conquer.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then when the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”</verse>
				<verse number="4">And another horse, fiery red, came out, and the one who rode it was granted permission to take peace from the earth, so that people would butcher one another, and he was given a huge sword.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then when the Lamb opened the third seal I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” So I looked, and here came a black horse! The one who rode it had a balance scale in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I heard something like a voice from among the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat will cost a day’s pay and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s pay. But do not damage the olive oil and the wine!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then when the Lamb opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">So I looked and here came a pale green horse! The name of the one who rode it was Death, and Hades followed right behind. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill its population with the sword, famine, and disease, and by the wild animals of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Now when the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been violently killed because of the word of God and because of the testimony they had given.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They cried out with a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Master, holy and true, before you judge those who live on the earth and avenge our blood?”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Each of them was given a long white robe and they were told to rest for a little longer, until the full number was reached of both their fellow servants and their brothers who were going to be killed just as they had been.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then I looked when the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and a huge earthquake took place; the sun became as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon became blood red;</verse>
				<verse number="13">and the stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when shaken by a fierce wind.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the kings of the earth, the very important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
				<verse number="17">because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to withstand it?”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so no wind could blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given permission to damage the earth and the sea:</verse>
				<verse number="3">“Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now I heard the number of those who were marked with the seal, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from all the tribes of the people of Israel:</verse>
				<verse number="5">From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,</verse>
				<verse number="6">from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,</verse>
				<verse number="7">from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,</verse>
				<verse number="8">from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">After these things I looked, and here was an enormous crowd that no one could count, made up of persons from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb dressed in long white robes, and with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They were shouting out in a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God, to the one seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">And all the angels stood there in a circle around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground before the throne and worshiped God,</verse>
				<verse number="12">saying, “Amen! Praise and glory, and wisdom and thanksgiving, and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then one of the elders asked me, “These dressed in long white robes — who are they and where have they come from?”</verse>
				<verse number="14">So I said to him, “My lord, you know the answer.” Then he said to me, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb!</verse>
				<verse number="15">For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple, and the one seated on the throne will shelter them.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They will never go hungry or be thirsty again, and the sun will not beat down on them, nor any burning heat,</verse>
				<verse number="17">because the Lamb in the middle of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="8">
				<verse number="1">Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Another angel holding a golden censer came and was stationed at the altar. A large amount of incense was given to him to offer up, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar that is before the throne.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The smoke coming from the incense, along with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth, and there were crashes of thunder, roaring, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Now the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The first angel blew his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown at the earth so that a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain of burning fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,</verse>
				<verse number="9">and a third of the creatures living in the sea died, and a third of the ships were completely destroyed.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a huge star burning like a torch fell from the sky; it landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
				<verse number="11">(Now the name of the star is Wormwood.) So a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from these waters because they were poisoned.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. And there was no light for a third of the day and for a third of the night likewise.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying directly overhead, proclaiming with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to blow them!”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="9">
				<verse number="1">Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He opened the shaft of the abyss and smoke rose out of it like smoke from a giant furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with smoke from the shaft.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then out of the smoke came locusts onto the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">They were told not to damage the grass of the earth, or any green plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their forehead.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The locusts were not given permission to kill them, but only to torture them for five months, and their torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In those days people will seek death, but will not be able to find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now the locusts looked like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were something like crowns similar to gold, and their faces looked like men’s faces.</verse>
				<verse number="8">They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots charging into battle.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They have tails and stingers like scorpions, and their ability to injure people for five months is in their tails.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They have as king over them the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The first woe has passed, but two woes are still coming after these things!</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a single voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God,</verse>
				<verse number="14">saying to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Set free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour, day, month, and year were set free to kill a third of humanity.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The number of soldiers on horseback was two hundred million; I heard their number.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Now this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision: The riders had breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfurous yellow in color. The heads of the horses looked like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths.</verse>
				<verse number="18">A third of humanity was killed by these three plagues, that is, by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths.</verse>
				<verse number="19">For the power of the horses resides in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having heads that inflict injuries.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The rest of humanity, who had not been killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood — idols that cannot see or hear or walk about.</verse>
				<verse number="21">Furthermore, they did not repent of their murders, of their magic spells, of their sexual immorality, or of their stealing.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He held in his hand a little scroll that was open, and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then he shouted in a loud voice like a lion roaring, and when he shouted, the seven thunders sounded their voices.</verse>
				<verse number="4">When the seven thunders spoke, I was preparing to write, but just then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders spoke and do not write it down.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven</verse>
				<verse number="6">and swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, and the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, “There will be no more delay!</verse>
				<verse number="7">But in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet, the mystery of God is completed, just as he has proclaimed to his servants the prophets.”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the voice I had heard from heaven began to speak to me again, “Go and take the open scroll in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take the scroll and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it, and it did taste as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then they told me: “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, and I was told, “Get up and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and the ones who worship there.</verse>
				<verse number="2">But do not measure the outer courtyard of the temple; leave it out, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">(These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.)</verse>
				<verse number="5">If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and completely consumes their enemies. If anyone wants to harm them, they must be killed this way.</verse>
				<verse number="6">These two have the power to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the time they are prophesying. They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they want.</verse>
				<verse number="7">When they have completed their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war on them and conquer them and kill them.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also crucified.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For three and a half days those from every people, tribe, nation, and language will look at their corpses, because they will not permit them to be placed in a tomb.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate, even sending gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But after three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and tremendous fear seized those who were watching them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them: “Come up here!” So the two prophets went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies stared at them.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Just then a major earthquake took place and a tenth of the city collapsed; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The second woe has come and gone; the third is coming quickly.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven saying: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.”</verse>
				<verse number="16">Then the twenty-four elders who are seated on their thrones before God threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and worshiped God</verse>
				<verse number="17">with these words: “We give you thanks, Lord God, the All-Powerful, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun to reign.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The nations were enraged, but your wrath has come, and the time has come for the dead to be judged, and the time has come to give to your servants, the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints and to those who revere your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then the temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was visible within his temple. And there were flashes of lightning, roaring, crashes of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Then a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and with the moon under her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
				<verse number="2">She was pregnant and was screaming in labor pains, struggling to give birth.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then another sign appeared in heaven: a huge red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadem crowns.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now the dragon’s tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born.</verse>
				<verse number="5">So the woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is going to rule over all the nations with an iron rod. Her child was suddenly caught up to God and to his throne,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and she fled into the wilderness where a place had been prepared for her by God, so she could be taken care of for 1,260 days.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But the dragon was not strong enough to prevail, so there was no longer any place left in heaven for him and his angels.</verse>
				<verse number="9">So that huge dragon — the ancient serpent, the one called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world — was thrown down to the earth, and his angels along with him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the ruling authority of his Christ, have now come, because the accuser of our brothers and sisters, the one who accuses them day and night before our God, has been thrown down.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Therefore you heavens rejoice, and all who reside in them! But woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you! He is filled with terrible anger, for he knows that he only has a little time!”</verse>
				<verse number="13">Now when the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.</verse>
				<verse number="14">But the woman was given the two wings of a giant eagle so that she could fly out into the wilderness, to the place God prepared for her, where she is taken care of — away from the presence of the serpent — for a time, times, and half a time.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the serpent spouted water like a river out of his mouth after the woman in an attempt to sweep her away by a flood,</verse>
				<verse number="16">but the earth came to her rescue; the ground opened up and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="17">So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her children, those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="18">And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="13">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns were ten diadem crowns, and on its heads a blasphemous name.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority to rule.</verse>
				<verse number="3">One of the beast’s heads appeared to have been killed, but the lethal wound had been healed. And the whole world followed the beast in amazement;</verse>
				<verse number="4">they worshiped the dragon because he had given ruling authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast too, saying: “Who is like the beast?” and “Who is able to make war against him?”</verse>
				<verse number="5">The beast was given a mouth speaking proud words and blasphemies, and he was permitted to exercise ruling authority for forty-two months.</verse>
				<verse number="6">So the beast opened his mouth to blaspheme against God — to blaspheme both his name and his dwelling place, that is, those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The beast was permitted to go to war against the saints and conquer them. He was given ruling authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and all those who live on the earth will worship the beast, everyone whose name has not been written since the foundation of the world in the book of life belonging to the Lamb who was killed.</verse>
				<verse number="9">If anyone has an ear, he had better listen!</verse>
				<verse number="10">If anyone is meant for captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed by the sword, then by the sword he must be killed. This requires steadfast endurance and faith from the saints.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but was speaking like a dragon.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He exercised all the ruling authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and those who inhabit it worship the first beast, the one whose lethal wound had been healed.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He performed momentous signs, even making fire come down from heaven in front of people</verse>
				<verse number="14">and, by the signs he was permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, he deceived those who live on the earth. He told those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had been wounded by the sword, but still lived.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The second beast was empowered to give life to the image of the first beast so that it could speak, and could cause all those who did not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He also caused everyone (small and great, rich and poor, free and slave ) to obtain a mark on their right hand or on their forehead.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Thus no one was allowed to buy or sell things unless he bore the mark of the beast — that is, his name or his number.</verse>
				<verse number="18">This calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the beast’s number, for it is man’s number, and his number is 666.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">Then I looked, and here was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were one hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I also heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. Now the sound I heard was like that made by harpists playing their harps,</verse>
				<verse number="3">and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one was able to learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="4">These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from humanity as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,</verse>
				<verse number="5">and no lie was found on their lips; they are blameless.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, and he had an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth — to every nation, tribe, language, and people.</verse>
				<verse number="7">He declared in a loud voice: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has arrived, and worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">A second angel followed the first, declaring: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great city! She made all the nations drink of the wine of her immoral passion.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">A third angel followed the first two, declaring in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and takes the mark on his forehead or his hand,</verse>
				<verse number="10">that person will also drink of the wine of God’s anger that has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tortured with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and in front of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="11">And the smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever, and those who worship the beast and his image will have no rest day or night, along with anyone who receives the mark of his name.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">This requires the steadfast endurance of the saints — those who obey God’s commandments and hold to their faith in Jesus.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: ‘Blessed are the dead, those who die in the Lord from this moment on!’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they can rest from their hard work, because their deeds will follow them.”</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man! He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then another angel came out of the temple, shouting in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and start to reap, because the time to reap has come, since the earth’s harvest is ripe!”</verse>
				<verse number="16">So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.</verse>
				<verse number="18">Another angel, who was in charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes off the vine of the earth, because its grapes are now ripe.”</verse>
				<verse number="19">So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth and tossed them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Then the winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood poured out of the winepress up to the height of horses’ bridles for a distance of almost two hundred miles.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="15">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw another great and astounding sign in heaven: seven angels who have seven final plagues (they are final because in them God’s anger is completed).</verse>
				<verse number="2">Then I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name. They were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps given to them by God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb: “Great and astounding are your deeds, Lord God, the All-Powerful! Just and true are your ways, King over the nations!</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name, because you alone are holy? All nations will come and worship before you for your righteous acts have been revealed.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">After these things I looked, and the temple (the tent of the testimony) was opened in heaven,</verse>
				<verse number="6">and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, dressed in clean bright linen, wearing wide golden belts around their chests.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and the temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and from his power. Thus no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues from the seven angels were completed.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="16">
				<verse number="1">Then I heard a loud voice from the temple declaring to the seven angels: “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls containing God’s wrath.”</verse>
				<verse number="2">So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth. Then ugly and painful sores appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Next, the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood, like that of a corpse, and every living creature that was in the sea died.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Now I heard the angel of the waters saying: “You are just — the one who is and who was, the Holy One — because you have passed these judgments,</verse>
				<verse number="6">because they poured out the blood of your saints and prophets, so you have given them blood to drink. They got what they deserved!”</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then I heard the altar reply, “Yes, Lord God, the All-Powerful, your judgments are true and just!”</verse>
				<verse number="8">Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was permitted to scorch people with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Thus people were scorched by the terrible heat, yet they blasphemed the name of God, who has ruling authority over these plagues, and they would not repent and give him glory.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast so that darkness covered his kingdom, and people began to bite their tongues because of their pain.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their sufferings and because of their sores, but nevertheless they still refused to repent of their deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates and dried up its water to prepare the way for the kings from the east.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Then I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</verse>
				<verse number="14">For they are the spirits of the demons performing signs who go out to the kings of the earth to bring them together for the battle that will take place on the great day of God, the All-Powerful.</verse>
				<verse number="15">(Look! I will come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays alert and does not lose his clothes so that he will not have to walk around naked and his shameful condition be seen.)</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now the spirits gathered the kings and their armies to the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Finally the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying: “It is done!”</verse>
				<verse number="18">Then there were flashes of lightning, roaring, and crashes of thunder, and there was a tremendous earthquake — an earthquake unequaled since humanity has been on the earth, so tremendous was that earthquake.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The great city was split into three parts and the cities of the nations collapsed. So Babylon the great was remembered before God, and was given the cup filled with the wine made of God’s furious wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Every island fled away and no mountains could be found.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And gigantic hailstones, weighing about a hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people, but they blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, since it was so horrendous.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me. “Come,” he said, “I will show you the condemnation and punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,</verse>
				<verse number="2">with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the earth’s inhabitants got drunk with the wine of her immorality.”</verse>
				<verse number="3">So he carried me away in the Spirit to a wilderness, and there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Now the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet clothing, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held in her hand a golden cup filled with detestable things and unclean things from her sexual immorality.</verse>
				<verse number="5">On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the Mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of those who testified to Jesus. I was greatly astounded when I saw her.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But the angel said to me, “Why are you astounded? I will interpret for you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</verse>
				<verse number="8">The beast you saw was, and is not, but is about to come up from the abyss and then go to destruction. The inhabitants of the earth — all those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world — will be astounded when they see that the beast was, and is not, but is to come.</verse>
				<verse number="9">(This requires a mind that has wisdom.) The seven heads are seven mountains the woman sits on. They are also seven kings:</verse>
				<verse number="10">five have fallen; one is, and the other has not yet come, but whenever he does come, he must remain for only a brief time.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The beast that was, and is not, is himself an eighth king and yet is one of the seven, and is going to destruction.</verse>
				<verse number="12">The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but will receive ruling authority as kings with the beast for one hour.</verse>
				<verse number="13">These kings have a single intent, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
				<verse number="14">They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those accompanying the Lamb are the called, chosen, and faithful.”</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw (where the prostitute is seated) are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The ten horns that you saw, and the beast — these will hate the prostitute and make her desolate and naked. They will consume her flesh and burn her up with fire.</verse>
				<verse number="17">For God has put into their minds to carry out his purpose by making a decision to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.</verse>
				<verse number="18">As for the woman you saw, she is the great city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">After these things I saw another angel, who possessed great authority, coming down out of heaven, and the earth was lit up by his radiance.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He shouted with a powerful voice: “Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great! She has become a lair for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detested beast.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For all the nations have fallen from the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior.”</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, so you will not take part in her sins and so you will not receive her plagues,</verse>
				<verse number="5">because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Repay her the same way she repaid others; pay her back double corresponding to her deeds. In the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her.</verse>
				<verse number="7">As much as she exalted herself and lived in sensual luxury, to this extent give her torment and grief because she said to herself, ‘I rule as queen and am no widow; I will never experience grief!’</verse>
				<verse number="8">For this reason, she will experience her plagues in a single day: disease, mourning, and famine, and she will be burned down with fire, because the Lord God who judges her is powerful!”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the kings of the earth who committed immoral acts with her and lived in sensual luxury with her will weep and wail for her when they see the smoke from the fire that burns her up.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment, and will say, “Woe, woe, O great city, Babylon the powerful city! For in a single hour your doom has come!”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her because no one buys their cargo any longer —</verse>
				<verse number="12">cargo such as gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all sorts of things made of citron wood, all sorts of objects made of ivory, all sorts of things made of expensive wood, bronze, iron and marble,</verse>
				<verse number="13">cinnamon, spice, incense, perfumed ointment, frankincense, wine, olive oil and costly flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and four-wheeled carriages, slaves and human lives.</verse>
				<verse number="14">(The ripe fruit you greatly desired has gone from you, and all your luxury and splendor have gone from you — they will never ever be found again!)</verse>
				<verse number="15">The merchants who sold these things, who got rich from her, will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment. They will weep and mourn,</verse>
				<verse number="16">saying, “Woe, woe, O great city — dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet clothing, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls —</verse>
				<verse number="17">because in a single hour such great wealth has been destroyed!” And every ship’s captain, and all who sail along the coast — seamen, and all who make their living from the sea, stood a long way off</verse>
				<verse number="18">and began to shout when they saw the smoke from the fire that burned her up, “Who is like the great city?”</verse>
				<verse number="19">And they threw dust on their heads and were shouting with weeping and mourning, “Woe, Woe, O great city — in which all those who had ships on the sea got rich from her wealth — because in a single hour she has been destroyed!”</verse>
				<verse number="20">(Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has pronounced judgment against her on your behalf!)</verse>
				<verse number="21">Then one powerful angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone, threw it into the sea, and said, “With this kind of sudden violent force Babylon the great city will be thrown down and it will never be found again!</verse>
				<verse number="22">And the sound of the harpists, musicians, flute players, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again. No craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again; the noise of a mill will never be heard in you again.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Even the light from a lamp will never shine in you again! The voices of the bridegroom and his bride will never be heard in you again. For your merchants were the tycoons of the world, because all the nations were deceived by your magic spells!</verse>
				<verse number="24">The blood of the saints and prophets was found in her, along with the blood of all those who had been killed on the earth.”</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="19">
				<verse number="1">After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a vast throng in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</verse>
				<verse number="2">because his judgments are true and just. For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and has avenged the blood of his servants poured out by her own hands!”</verse>
				<verse number="3">Then a second time the crowd shouted, “Hallelujah!” The smoke rises from her forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures threw themselves to the ground and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne, saying: “Amen! Hallelujah!”</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God all you his servants, and all you who fear Him, both the small and the great!”</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a vast throng, like the roar of many waters and like loud crashes of thunder. They were shouting: “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the All-Powerful, reigns!</verse>
				<verse number="7">Let us rejoice and exult and give him glory, because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.</verse>
				<verse number="8">She was permitted to be dressed in bright, clean, fine linen” (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then the angel said to me, “Write the following: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” He also said to me, “These are the true words of God.”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So I threw myself down at his feet to worship him, but he said, “Do not do this! I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony about Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw heaven opened and here came a white horse! The one riding it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice he judges and goes to war.</verse>
				<verse number="12">His eyes are like a fiery flame and there are many diadem crowns on his head. He has a name written that no one knows except himself.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He is dressed in clothing dipped in blood, and he is called the Word of God.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The armies that are in heaven, dressed in white, clean, fine linen, were following him on white horses.</verse>
				<verse number="15">From his mouth extends a sharp sword, so that with it he can strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod, and he stomps the winepress of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He has a name written on his clothing and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”</verse>
				<verse number="17">Then I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he shouted in a loud voice to all the birds flying high in the sky: “Come, gather around for the great banquet of God,</verse>
				<verse number="18">to eat your fill of the flesh of kings, the flesh of generals, the flesh of powerful people, the flesh of horses and those who ride them, and the flesh of all people, both free and slave, and small and great!”</verse>
				<verse number="19">Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to do battle with the one who rode the horse and with his army.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Now the beast was seized, and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs on his behalf — signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.</verse>
				<verse number="21">The others were killed by the sword that extended from the mouth of the one who rode the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="20">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain.</verse>
				<verse number="2">He seized the dragon — the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan — and tied him up for a thousand years.</verse>
				<verse number="3">The angel then threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it so that he could not deceive the nations until the one thousand years were finished. (After these things he must be released for a brief period of time.)</verse>
				<verse number="4">Then I saw thrones and seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. These had not worshiped the beast or his image and had refused to receive his mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
				<verse number="5">(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished.) This is the first resurrection.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Blessed and holy is the one who takes part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Now when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison</verse>
				<verse number="8">and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to bring them together for the battle. They are as numerous as the grains of sand in the sea.</verse>
				<verse number="9">They went up on the broad plain of the earth and encircled the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them completely.</verse>
				<verse number="10">And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they will be tormented there day and night forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Then I saw a large white throne and the one who was seated on it; the earth and the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. Then books were opened, and another book was opened — the book of life. So the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="13">The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each one was judged according to his deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death — the lake of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="15">If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, that person was thrown into the lake of fire.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="21">
				<verse number="1">Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth had ceased to exist, and the sea existed no more.</verse>
				<verse number="2">And I saw the holy city — the new Jerusalem — descending out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: “Look! The residence of God is among human beings. He will live among them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them.</verse>
				<verse number="4">He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not exist any more — or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things have ceased to exist.”</verse>
				<verse number="5">And the one seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new!” Then he said to me, “Write it down, because these words are reliable and true.”</verse>
				<verse number="6">He also said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty I will give water free of charge from the spring of the water of life.</verse>
				<verse number="7">The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</verse>
				<verse number="8">But to the cowards, unbelievers, detestable persons, murderers, the sexually immoral, and those who practice magic spells, idol worshipers, and all those who lie, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. That is the second death.”</verse>
				<verse number="9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues came and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">So he took me away in the Spirit to a huge, majestic mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The city possesses the glory of God; its brilliance is like a precious jewel, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper.</verse>
				<verse number="12">It has a massive, high wall with twelve gates, with twelve angels at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel are written on the gates.</verse>
				<verse number="13">There are three gates on the east side, three gates on the north side, three gates on the south side and three gates on the west side.</verse>
				<verse number="14">The wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The angel who spoke to me had a golden measuring rod with which to measure the city and its foundation stones and wall.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Now the city is laid out as a square, its length and width the same. He measured the city with the measuring rod at fourteen hundred miles (its length and width and height are equal).</verse>
				<verse number="17">He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits according to human measurement, which is also the angel’s.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The city’s wall is made of jasper and the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
				<verse number="19">The foundations of the city’s wall are decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</verse>
				<verse number="20">the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
				<verse number="21">And the twelve gates are twelve pearls — each one of the gates is made from just one pearl! The main street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
				<verse number="22">Now I saw no temple in the city, because the Lord God — the All-Powerful — and the Lamb are its temple.</verse>
				<verse number="23">The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
				<verse number="24">The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their grandeur into it.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Its gates will never be closed during the day (and there will be no night there).</verse>
				<verse number="26">They will bring the grandeur and the wealth of the nations into it,</verse>
				<verse number="27">but nothing ritually unclean will ever enter into it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="22">
				<verse number="1">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life — water as clear as crystal — pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</verse>
				<verse number="2">flowing down the middle of the city’s main street. On each side of the river is the tree of life producing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month of the year. Its leaves are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
				<verse number="3">And there will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him,</verse>
				<verse number="4">and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Night will be no more, and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Then the angel said to me, “These words are reliable and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.”</verse>
				<verse number="7">(Look! I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy expressed in this book.)</verse>
				<verse number="8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw them, I threw myself down to worship at the feet of the angel who was showing them to me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">But he said to me, “Do not do this! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets, and with those who obey the words of this book. Worship God!”</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy contained in this book, because the time is near.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The evildoer must continue to do evil, and the one who is morally filthy must continue to be filthy. The one who is righteous must continue to act righteously, and the one who is holy must continue to be holy.”</verse>
				<verse number="12">(Look! I am coming soon, and my reward is with me to pay each one according to what he has done!</verse>
				<verse number="13">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end!)</verse>
				<verse number="14">Blessed are those who wash their robes so they can have access to the tree of life and can enter into the city by the gates.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral, and the murderers, and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood!</verse>
				<verse number="16">“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star!”</verse>
				<verse number="17">And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say: “Come!” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wants it take the water of life free of charge.</verse>
				<verse number="18">I testify to the one who hears the words of the prophecy contained in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="19">And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book.</verse>
				<verse number="20">The one who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon!” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
				<verse number="21">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.</verse>
